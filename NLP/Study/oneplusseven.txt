Display. The major pro is the damn smooth 90 Hz refresh rate along with QHD+ screen. It's as smooth as a butter!2. Ram Boost - The phone learns your behaviour like which apps you use most and accordingly allocates ram towards it making the phone even faster.3. Speed. Nothing to say about this. It's blazing fast.4. Warp charging. The phone gets charged upto 50% in about half an hour and completely in about 75 minutes.5. Completely stoked with the battery after a heavy usage of 9.5 hour screen time with playing games for 2 hours and using Netflix for 7 hours in a single charge.Cons-1. Including camera here for the time being until a major update comes our and improves the camera firmware. As of now, not a flagship camera by miles.2. Lack of IP rating, not that it matters to me. The phone's tested enough in water.3. Lack of wireless charging.

Nebula Blue is a beauty!\n", 'I\'ve been using the phone for a week now and the only thing I hate about this phone is the camera. Dear OnePlus, please sort out this asap. The camera is not what you expect for the price and the image processing is "bitter" this time.Except for that single thing, This phone is the snappiest one yet released in 2019 and they have done no compromise with the display. The 90Hz display is just mind-blowing and I can guarantee you that once you get adjusted to those curved sides of the display, you won\'t take your eyes off it.Then there are some minor bugs which will be sorted out later on with updates. The phone feels great in the hands even though people claims it to be a bit heavier than other flagships. But I personally love the feel of the phone in my hands, it\'s just a solid feel. The buttons are placed perfectly in this phone, you won\'t accidentally hit any buttons on either sides.If you have the money to spend, this is the best choice as of today and if you\'re preferring the best camera phone in a budhet, go for Pixel 3a and if the price is not a problem for you there are several other phones in the market.Don\'t worry about the missing ip rating and the fact that this phone doesn\'t have wireless charging feature, the warp charge doess all justice to you.The fingerprint has improved so much that it\'s almost as fast as a conventional scanner.Yes, you\'re going to miss the face unlock feature. It\'s still there but it\'s not worth your time.So overall, go get this device after keeping this information in mind.There\'s one more thing I noticed in another review here in the Amazon page, that a customer saying that he didn\'t recieve the wireless bullets and two extra cases as seen in many review videos on youtube. Please, those are the review packages that youtubers get to review the phone. The in box contents are clearly given in the description, so please don\'t underrate the phone due to these reasons.Hope you have a great time enjoying this phone.

No notch whatsoever.3. Near Stock Android experience.4. OP is great in pushing updates regularly which is a rare thing even with Samsung\'s flagship phones.Pro\'s :1.  QHD screen is just gorgeous with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Near Stock Android experience with some very useful features like screen recorder, ability to switch between QHD & FHD+, etc3. Fast Charging (coutsey OPPO\'s VOOC Charge 3).4. Good ROM options.5. ZEN mode to log you out of the smartphone for 20 minutes.6. Full screen without a notch makes video streaming a great experience.7. Apps open fast, really fast.8. Pop Up camera is really fast during face recognition. Many times you may not even notice that the POP UP camera really came out of the slot retracted. It\'s that fast.CON\'s :1. Battery drain gets hampered if you run it in QHD with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is not up to the mark as compared to OnePlus 6 apart from the options of wide angle. (maybe software update will improve its usability, perticularly while shooting videos in wide angle).3 Camera clicks 12 MP shots in default mode. Night mode is so-so but don\'t compare it with Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL or even with Pixel 3a XL. Pixel is way ahead in terms of resolution perticularly in night mode.4. Day time photos are much better when compared to OnePlus 6 perticularly where good light is not an issue. Photography during "conference" might be tricky. This is where Pixel will overshadow all other smartphones.5. This is a big phone in the territory of a tablet. Handling it might be a bit difficult for some. Single hand use is not advisable.Will update after a few more days of use.UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS OF USAGE :Most of the users of OnePlus 7 Pro (as per the reviews) would be happy with budget handset like Redmi or Realme as they are either using OnePlus 7 Pro for the sake of it or to play games. Whether your handset has 2GB RAM free or not has nothing to do with the performance. What makes a difference is the availability of RAM for a perticular task. RAM management is very good like all the previous OnePlus devices.IPhone XS Max also doesn\'t give a headset or even a dongle to use it with 3.5 mm headphone jack but people do buy iPhone without thinking twice. Iphone doesn\'t even give fast charging brick in the box. When people can spend a lack of rupees for a brand why complain about OnePlus 7 Pro.Call quality of OP 7 Pro is good. Even video calling over Whatsapp and Skype is good.It\'s a pleasure using OnePlus 7 Pro for creating Word documents, PPT\'s, Excel Sheets on the go. These apps use a lot of battery and RAM. Adobe Reader is just fluid. RAM management while using these apps and switching between them is just beautiful and seamless.Will update after a few more days......As expected, OnePlus released an update on the general performance and camera issue.Camera quality is quite subjective and uncontrollable since everyone can capture an awful photo in a random scenario. Even though the photo is not quite bad technically, there is always someone giving negative opinion only for the reason that he likes more appealing photo style. Every time when there is a photo sent to us due to negative feedback, our engineers are requested to find the same light condition and object of same color and texture to simulate the photo in order to reproduce the same problem. You can imagine the time and workload needed for fixing every single problem, not to mention the dozens of photos we got from all over the world everyday.

The display and performance are absolutely mind blowing. Camera may not be the best but it's still top class. The phone isn't as big as people would think it is. It's actually pretty sleek and feels nice in the hands as it isn't very broad. The battery performance is commendable given the 90hz refresh rate and the QHD display. Would easily last a day on normal usage. Although, Heavy users would require around half an hour of charging. Warp charge is super fast, you won't even realise how quickly your phone charges after you plug it in. Oxygen works buttery smooth and as a first time user of this UI, I'm liking it quite a lot. Gaming is wonderful too, absolutely smooth, beautiful and lag free. The accompanying phone cover is good too, it just gets smudged by finger prints though. As someone who watched reviews of different phones and was well versed with what I was buying, I'm enjoying every second of using this phone.Most of the reviewers here are complaining about not receiving headphones and extra covers and a screen guard with bubbles, it's absolutely absurd. You should atleast look over what you're buying first thoroughly, and any reasonable man would have easily found out what he's get in the box and what he's not getting. These illiterate people buy stuff without knowing anything and then expect candies in the damn box and when they don't get it, write negative reviews which influence other queer buyers. It's highly unfortunate.For all those looking for the best performing Device available right now, go for it, if you can compromise with the headphone jack (get a 3.5mm to c type cable and problem solved). Everything from the looks and feel to the performance of the phone is amazing. You'll feel that you're holding a flagship masterpiece every second you're holding this phone. It's easily the best phone in it's price range hands down.\n", "Battery is a weak.. Needs to charge twice a dayAnd apps also keep crashing...

Mi note 5 pro camera is far far better than this idot box.  48 MP camera is a joke.  The tech reviewers gave biased reviews. Don't even try to compare with MI note 7 pro 48MP setup.  Nothing in the product will amaze you,  you will end up with a huge disappointment... Ram management is pathetic,  battery is below average.  Go for google pixel rather than this.\n", "I didn't believe the reviewers. I bought the phone. And now I don't like any other phones except OnePlus 7 Pro.90Hz - It's madness. Imagine this - Drinking alcohol is injurious to health, but if you drink it you'll feel good. Right? 90Hz would give you the best smartphone experience, but it drains some more battery compared to 60Hz. Moderate drinking is perfectly fine; charging the phone 2 times a day is fine too. (I'm a heavy user)Warp charger - Charges the phone at remarkable speeds. If you're a previous OnePlus user, you won't find much of a difference.Camera - Definitely the best, in accordance with pricing.Everything else - as accurate as in the product description.My favorite retarded reviews :*Someone was upset that he couldn't find a 'OnePlus backpack' and a 'OnePlus water bottle' in the package.*Someone was upset that he found an air bubble under the phone's screen guard.\n", "Big issue with touchscreen..when I try n write it starts video call on wattsapp..

Super AMOLED with 90Hz refresh rate. The colours are vivid and contents are crisp, also, with the video enhancement ratio turned on, the contrast ratio is really kicking in. However, you do not get a Samsung or Apple level display but at this price point, this is a steal.Display Rating - 9/10.Sound:Dolby Atmos gives you the stereo sound that OnePlus has promised and it makes you feel immersed in whatever video you\'re watching or game you\'re playing with addition to the full screen display. However, it\'s not the best sound I\'ve heard on a phone, but it\'s much better than a lot of phones. And also, it doesn\'t have "equal" amplitude of sound coming out of both speakers. The bottom one is more powerful, probably because it\'s the main speaker for ringtones. Overall, it\'s a good speaker for normal users, for audiophiles - not so great.Sound rating - 8/10Camera:When I first turned the camera on, my mind was blown, probably because of the cheerleading effect of the high quality AMOLED display, but even so, it put up competition with devices that took photo with Google Camera Mod or even the Google Pixel\'s camera as well. In some cases it was great, in some it was lacking. Overall, the dynamic range is great but not the best. The colours are more true to life, and in the normal / auto camera mode it offers an image of size 12MP. True 48MP images can be taken with the pro mode, and if you can set your camera up properly, you can take amazing photos of the milky way and stars, so it\'s a powerful camera. The Ultra-Wide camera needs some work done as the details look washed out on the pictures taken Ultra-Wide angle lens. The telephoto lens does its job well up to 3x zoom, but it does produce a tad bit of noise. And the night mode is especially good, it preserves the highlights and details and also lightens up the shadows during very challenging conditions. Amazing night mode. And as for selfies, yes, it\'s amazing, offering upto 16MP including the precise edge detection in portrait mode of both the back and front, the cameras are great. The OnePlus 7 Pro offers video recording of upto 4K 60FPS which is great and offers slow mo video of upto 240fps in 720p. However, there was a really annoying little problem, which was shutter lag, that\'s probably because of the software and I hope OnePlus improves that. Otherwise some pictures might be ruined because of it. Overall the camera is decent, and not the best.Camera Rating: 8/10Fingerprint Scanner: Even though it\'s an optical image fingerprint sensor in the age of newly invented ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, it\'s fast. Not as much as the physical ones but it\'s definitely the fastest optical fingerprint sensor I\'ve ever used. And the animation looks cool.Fingerprint scanner rating: 9/10UI: OxygenOS is the best UI you can get from a company. It is definitely smooth, fast and easy to use and doesn\'t look like a bootleg Android and at least it doesn\'t annoy people with bloatwares and advertisements in the utility apps. It has a lot of features and is highly customizable.UI Rating: 10/10Build: As much sexy as it looks, the OnePlus 7 Pro is fragile if it falls from your hands. Although glass looks premium and feels premium, I\'d rather prefer a metal aluminium body. However, with the addition of curved display, a mechanical camera and the glass back, I\'m in love with the design. It is definitely one of it\'s major selling points. The only other con is the lack of headphone jack, but it would have been consider if OnePlus would have at least included a pair of type-C headphones or at least a type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack converter. Keep up the good work, OnePlus!Build rating: 8/10Hardware: The OnePlus 7 Pro rocks a Snapdragon 855 chipset with Adreno 640, and everything you run on this device from games to Antutu 3D benchmarks, everything runs as smooth as butter with no fps drop or stuttering whatsoever, and doesn\'t heat up very much as well. However it still doesn\'t surpass a lot of phones if you match the scores.Hardware rating: 9/10In the Box content: In the box you get a 30W Warp Charge supported charging block with cool red type C cable to charge your phone, a flexible rubber case which is a good addition, some papers with a letter from Pete Lau but unfortunately not type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter or type-C headphones. Huge disappointment.In the Box contents rating: 7/10So overall, we can conclude the OnePlus 7 Pro is a fantastic device but the price could have been at least 3K INR less, even after considering the lack of headphones or the converter, and to retain its title of "Flagship Killer". Unfortunately, OnePlus has lost it.Overall Rating: 8.5/10\n', 'Everything was cool but felt missing abt in box accessories could have provided type c to 3.5mm converter along in the box\n', 'late Sound problem while pubg  using wireless earphonesNot problem in one plus 6t..\n', "Hi Team,I would like to bring this to your attention that the warp charger is charging really slow and not at all upto the mark. I am not sure if it has been changed during delivery or it was packaged like that. Although I am really happy with the phone's performance and battery life however the charger is not upto the mark. I charged my phone with my sister's dash charger and it charged my phone almost 3 times faster than warp charger.If possible, please pass it to the oneplus team or look into the delivery process.Thanks & Regards,Sahban khan\n", "Okay, so I will get straight to the pros and cons of this phone. I upgraded from 6T and let me share how well it stood up to my expectations in almost every aspect. My review will contain overall and a camparison with 6T.Pros1. Best display ever in a smartphone no doubt. 90hzQuad HD+ display seriously spoila you to an extent that you no longer wish to go back to 60hz.2. Build quality is purely flagship. It looks way beautiful than one plus 6T and it does feels super premium.3. Stereo speakers are a game changer. Loud and crisp noise as compared to one plus 6T and is definitely a demanding feature in a flagship.4. 30 watt WARP charge is a cherry on top. I had no complaint with Dash charge and it makes my experience even more better with Warp charge.5. Camera is very good as compared to one plus 6T and trust me, it won't let you down. Camera on 6T was just a crap.6. You don't have to even consider about performance as you know what one plus is famous for.7. I love the new vibration Moto and heptic feedback.Cons1. Battery backup is fine. For me it last for a day but considering the display, yes it may not perform well up to expectations of some people but trust me it's absolutely fine for a normal day usage.P.S. : for some peoywho are complaining that display color is not good as compared to s10+. Here is one suggestion guys. Just go to settings and adjust the display colors to AMOLED wide gamut. I can assure that the color accuracy will be exactly the same as that of s10+. I compared them side by side and found them exactly the same.Thanks and have a nice time with your One Plus 7 pro\n", 'Battery life is worst , worst.Worst\n', 'My wait for this phone is finally over. Received the phone in good condition. OnePlus7 pro has a Beautiful large screen resolution, great camera and incredible processor speed... Also a bigger battery backup with warp charge.\n', 'Amazing job OnePlus ..... An excellent phone with no bezels and the amazing screen that is smooth to work with .....Amazon thanks for delivering my phone overnight as that was some speedy work ..\n', "Settings are not working quick gestures features are not working ambient display features not workingFor replace no appointments are available  according to warp charger phone doesn't gets charged in 20minutes\n", "I was an apple fanboy since 2007. I had used every iPhone that got released in the market till iPhone X (not iPhone XS).  Since I got bored with the same OS for so many number of years, one fine day I decided to try android (keeping aside my ethical reservations about it, since it was an stolen OS as per late Steve Jobs)  and bought an Android AMOLED Phone (to test whether I can thrive on android eco system) which had an on screen finger print scanner.  Strangely, I started liking that android phone  since it had an iOS feel and used it for more  than 6 months.By then I was quite confident that I can rely on an android phone without any regrets and started looking for a flagship phone that can match to iPhone, in terms of Overall User Experience. While Galaxy S10 was one of the obvious choice, I was some how not happy with it(may be due to Apple Vs Samsung Long term dispute) , but  then  the OPP7 got released. :-)I waited and bought 12GB RAM+256GB Storage Phone on Amazon. Before I bought this phone I had read through many reviews online and got really worried about issues posted about this phone,  like ghost display, Mediocre Camera, bad call quality etc etc. Also many reviews for this phone on the  Amazon ltself was not good.  Still I stuck to my decision of buying this phone and let me tell you that I am extremely proud of my decision.Once I got this phone then it simply turned out to be an outstanding phone and completely changed my perceptions about stock android experience. Now I would want to say that it is one of the best phones in the market. While there are many good features as well few shortfalls on this phone,  end of the day the overall user experience is something that I liked utmost.My key take aways about the phone are- I am awestruck with the edge to edge, QHD AMOLED Display with 90 Hz refresh rates and the curved display. You can view everything at  best on this phone.- 12 Gigs RAM keeps the phone blazing fast on all the games I downloaded, of course Snapdragon 855 is an extremely efficient CPU.- Camera: While this was one of the concerns reported utmost by all in the reviews, with the latest software update I would want to say that I could make great photographs with both  48 pixel normal camera as well as with the pop-up Front facing camera. I simply loved the pictures I took on this phone and I am quite confident that it matches to the quality of iPXs Max even at the low light conditions (ensure for latest software updates). The 4k Video captures are great delight.- Warp charge: Can't belive that it took less than hour to charge my phone from less than 5 to 100 %. I have to say Kudos.- Oxygen OS: Simply minimalistic, yet very beautiful. One Plus team has paid every attention to the detail in building this OS. All my need for using a Gesture based OS is completely taken care.- Speakers: Great Stereo speaker alignment with Dolby Atmos experience. While it sounds great, I would want to say that it is not the best audio experience. However there are no regrets.- Build Quality: Overall build quality is absolute wonderful. I loved that buttery touch whether on the screen or on the back.- Weight: That 206 gm of weight in the hand made me to feel that it is a worthy and reliable phone and not just another one of the bunch in the market.- Pre-applied screen guard: Very Happy about it. At least it is not tamper prone out of box. Same logic for the free case that ensures that my device is safe, atleast initially.- Size: While I have seen many complaints about the giagantic size of this phone, my take on it is that it is simply fine. After all for the greater user experience we do need a good screen size phone.- Notifications: Let me tell you that I am extremely particular about the efficiency of notifications from SMS and Whatsapp messages. While my earlier android phone is not efficient as iPhone in this aspect, OP7P had ensured this to me. Very greatful!!Area of Improvements- Battery life: Unless we are concious about managing battery life, it may not lost long especially with the 90 Hz screen refresh rates- No Wireless Charging: Personally I damn care about it. I never used that feature in my iPhone X. But still a drawback.- No Headphone: Exactly same as above. Something not worry much with many bluetooth headphone options. I have paired my Airpod and it works simply great.- No IP Rating: I am very much sure that this phone is splash resistant as well  water resistant for minimal time and I am extremely happy with it. After all I am not a professional swimmer with the intent to use this phone underwater. (with all due respect to the swimmmers)Few aspects about my purchase from Amazon:- Concept of guaranteed price for phones from Amazon was very useful for me. I exchanged my recently bought first android phone and got a good value for exchange- Interest free EMI and discount on my SBI card made me to feel happy- Almost same day delivery of the phone. What else I can ask for.Finally I would want to say that I am not paid by any one (especially by OPO) to write this review but it is an honest user experience by a tech enthusiast.  Still, for any questions, please feel free to write a reply to this post and I will try to respond it asap.\n", "It's worth the price. Yeah camera performance should be improved. Battery life for 90 Hertz refresh rate is not bad. Fingerprint sensor is faster than 6T.What I observed from people rating is they are disappointed because OnePlus didn't include type-c to 3.5mm cable and earphones because of high price.I think because of customers disappointment rating going down. OnePlus should think on it and should get back customers satisfaction.Overall phone performance will never disappoint you. Should include basic accessories to satisfy the customers.\n", '#Stunned #Awesome# Super thrilledApril 2014.. The One plus silently entered the market and making a small ripples ..No one ever expected that it sweeps as Tsunami. I still remember the day when I bought the One Plus One. Happily showing to people about the greatest product . Sadly at that time no one aware about the phone but now we all know who is the real beastSlowly and steadily the brand was reaching all over .The word ‚ÄúThe Flagship Killer‚Äù literally killing the people all over. No one ever expected that it will capture the market just like that.From One plus we had more market players all were trying to reach the level of One Plus sadly the truth no one reached to it and still it holds the position.After One Plus one I was like missing the opportunity of moving to the next phone.. But my One Plus one was scoring so good so I didn‚Äôt feel for the next one..Time moves.. Used other products so called copycat of the Flag Ship Killer phones none were like my One Plus one. Something or other was missing.Now I don‚Äôt want to lose the opportunity so I banged on the first day and booked the ‚Äú The Real Flagship Killer‚Äù One Plus 7 Pro 8GB 256 storage.Now my Beast in Power on Mode and will Unleash soon‚Ä¶ Will come back soon with my next review of Pictures and Performance and all ..\n', "Today I received the parcel intact.The parcel contained only the phone and it's charger.There was no ear phone, operation manual,I find in a youtube regarding one plus 7 box containing earphone, operating manual,two type of mob.cover.(color choice).I would like to know the reason for the missing item.Please respond.\n", "Firstly, it's a review after 2 days of use. And what's not to like about this phone.If you're here then you already know the specs and I don't need to reiterate it. Its a beast, a killer phone.Things you'll love:1. Best camera performance.2. Amazing display (90 hz refresh rate and probably the brightest screen in the market)3. Super fast speed.4. Stereo speakers.5. Warp charge is amazingly fast (0 to 100% in 1 hr)6. An AnTuTu score of 367202. Beating 93% of all other phones out there.7. Price (at this price range you can't find a premium phone like this one)Things you'll miss:1. 3.5mm jack2.

However, the pre-applied screen protector is filled with bubbles and dust particles and seems like someone unprofessional has been applying these! I request you to please look into it and provide me with a possible solution as it has totally ruined the experience of owning a flagship and getting this kind of service!\n", "\xa0I got this phone on 3rd June and just within a week's time I am facing battery related issues.Do not rush into buying this phone, wait for a while more and ask other OnePlus users if they are facing the same issues.  Maybe I got a defected piece . They even refused for a replacement. All they did was a 5 minute video check where in if the phone battery drops then 5% they replace else they dont.Just go through the video and you shall understand the entire scenario.Feel as if 50k wasted.\n", "Awesome product. Bought it despite of all criticism. Happy with my decision. When you are a tough competitor than people starts hating you, that's common. Display and performance are the benchmarks. Camera too is doing well with the latest updates, that's what i love most about the OnePlus, they listen to their community and keep you updated from all bugs. It's not light weight so if you are a skinny guy then forget about it or else go for it. Best phone under 50k. If you found it helpful then no need to smash the like button, you just go for this beast. Peace out\n", 'Bang for buck phone n a rel flagship killerPros:1. Great built quality, which matches with other premium flagships in the market2. Best part is its display. Large 6.7 inch mesmerising oled display, with gorilla 5 glass n notch free design.

No 3.5 earphone Jack, USB C to 3.5 adaptor n earphones not provided despite this high price pointBattery will last over a day with moderate use, and at FHD+ it will last even more. Camera is good, if not the best.For this phone, Pros clearly win over the cons. Go for it\n', "Writing this review after completely understanding this masterpiece. Transforming from IOs to Android was a cakewalk for me thanks to my OnePlus 3T. Even today after almost 3 years of its use I saw no lag issues, no issues with the battery and instant rapid charging which was the really the most important plus point for me.This Version of OnePlus is surely a masterpiece. Be it the speed, the battery backup, rapid WARP charging, Be it the huge screen and yes the premium look makes it a worth buy. It's been 2 days I own it and everyone who looks at it is amazed to see how perfectly everything is compiled to make this masterpiece. The camera is amazing with three modes as described during the launch with an amazing picture quality.  The music with stereo sound and Dolby Atmos  makes it so much full of life..  The only Cons you can find with this device is the absence of Water resistant label. Rest it is BEYOND PERFECTION.\n", 'Powerfully conceived and surely is a great upgrade for those replacing a phone after 2+ years. Processor is great, audio is loud and clear. Price is on the higher end but a worthy deal for people intense on email, social media and fast communication. Miss the 3.5mm jack or the in case wired headset but battery and display makes it up. Had it been, wireless charging could have taken this far further but love the warp charging. Fast fingerprint recognition and selfie camera allows decent face recognition. Oneplus has greatly enhanced the Android underneath. Worthy call if you need speed & quality.\n', "I had purchased one Plus 7 pro 8 GB Almond color from Amazon based on a friend's suggestion but totally regret the purchase. I'm a new user for One Plus & previously owned Apple, Vivo,Letv, Coolpad, Samsung, Honor, Motorola,Xolo,etc.,never experienced such an awkward performance in those mobile's. Spending half a Lakh Indian rupees on this mobile the File manager videos file's takes time to load in order to open the same, While on call second call gets answered automatically, Both front & Back camera clarity are not up to the mark & there are lots of other issues while using the mobile I'm not at all happy using this device & feel like exploited for buying a premium range mobile with a basic mobile's performance. Need a solution for the same at the earliest.\n", "Ok first let me tell you something. All the negative reviews are before the OTA update.

So install Gcam and it will do wonders.\n", "This is my first phone in the premium category and I'm glad I went ahead with investing those extra 20000 rupees for a phone. 12 GB of RAM will look after every thing that you can ever ask of a phone. I had no idea of what difference a screen of 90Hz refresh rate or 60Hz meant. But after using this phone and having seen my friend's 6T I can say that a 90 Hz screen is so buttery smooth that it spoils you. Fingerprint scanner has gotten better with every touch. Battery performance isn't too great but it does charge lighting quick. The curved screen and the Fluid Amoled Display just packs that final punch.It's not always we think of going for a 50k+ phone and if you're thinking of upgrading your phone and have the budget, go for OP7Pro without any apprehensions.Edit: I'm no pro photograper but the camera seems to be better with additional features after the Android 10 update.\n", 'Good phone. - Review after usage for a week.Best Full screen display i have used till now.

Once you get used to 90hz display all the other phones will be a joke in terms of scrolling performance.3. Great camera.

Dont think any phone has this smooth touch!It lived to all my expectations and was worth the wait.My friend used my phone for a while and bought one for himself too!Highly recommend the phone to people looking for flagship phone.Remember, it is flagship phone with amazing hardware and features and hence the price. :-)\n', "S10(+) vs OP7Pro.. I chose this since it's superior in the OS, Warp charge, SD855 gaming and few more. It also matches up with its OLED display to the major flagships out there.

Camera quality is not up to the DXO mark, but would be improved by software updates which are seamless on 1+ devices\n", "Loved it. But it has its own pros n cons. Best screen ever, with Dolby stereo speaker really awesome performance while playing games like pub g and call of duty. I have been using since two weeks now never felt a lag. But price is too high.

But what's the meaning of phone without headphone jack or connector. If we are buying the phone of 50000, the company cant even provide us the connector for earphone?

We expect all accessories for the same.\n", 'Feels very premium to hold and the 90 hz refresh rate is just too good.. feel like its a bit over priced.. and for those who expected 2 cases and wireless earphones, its a special review package which is clearly told by the presenter.. there is no earphone or even 3.5 mm earphone adapter which should be bought from after market.. All the functions of the phone works like a breeze.. no issues so far.. overall its a good phone..\n', "The OnePlus 7 pro is a large phone at 6.7 inches. It is heavier than you'd expect and is a little difficult to use single handedly. The bezel less screen sometimes makes it hard to use gesture navigation. Besides this there is literally nothing to complain about. The phone is incredibly fast, the display is incredibly satisfying, the camera is great even if it isn't the absolute best, and the UI is brilliant.Recommend to anyone looking for a phone in this price range if one handed use is not a big concern.\n", "Great phone and awesome performance.. Tested it with all kind of games and applications... Now without wasting any time I would like to share pros and cons :Cons-1. Average battery life (6 hrs SOT)2. Average camera quality (improved with the latest update)3. Dust magnet. I have covered Op7 pro with in box cover and also tried ringke cover but dust is all over the phone.

Awesome screen. Loved the 90hz thing. Very quick in response.3. Nightscape mode is awesome after update. Compared with s10+ and difference are unimaginable. Op7 pro's images are better and clearer than s10+. You can see the difference of HDR+ images.4. Oxygen os is far better than stock android.5. Stereo speakers are upto the mark. Compared with other dual speakers phone and sound is clear and easily heard in crowded places.6. Using type C bullet earphones with this and get awesome output from device.In the end it is the user liking or disliking about this specific device. Some people impressed with the image quality and some aren't. Some people liked the sound and some referred it as a noise. Build quality is upto the mark.

(best os ever)Weight - the phone is a lit bit heavy.. but if you use the case you wont feel it heavy..\n", "Fast and great phoneFast chargingOk camera better in gcam appBattery is not great in 90hz displayYou change to 60hz and battery saver it helpsAnd 90hz display is really great really smoothIt's offering a lot of value for the priceBecause the s10 iPhone are way more expensiveAsus Zenfone 6 and k20 pro all have regular diaplays that's why their cheapThis has a oled (very good )The os is really good better than stock AndroidLot of featuresIf you have the money go for it\n", "I ordered my OnePlus 7 Pro with lot of doubts in mind specially it not being water resistant and camera quality in previous versions.I highly recommend the OnePlus 7pro and writing this review so it might help others .Pro-1) Screen - Best Screen so far on any phone and with 90Hz refresh rate it is best mobile to play games with . I love playing PUBG and Asphalt 9 on Top setting and Result are terrific.2) Portrait Mode - OnePlus has never been the Best Camera device in market but OnePlus7pro has one top notch portrait mode. You will love taking Portrait in this device.3) Speed - With Latest 855 Snapdragon , I never laid hands on such smooth Android device . I can directly compare smoothness to IphoneX on this device.4) Built Quality - OnePlus 7 Pro has very strong built quality which I found very impressive. I did checked out YouTube videos to found its durability and was impressed.5) OxygenOS: With OxygenOS the experience of Android is smooth as silk.Cons :Water Proof : Only reason to not buy this mammoth phone . I was planning Huawei P30 Pro but then we have water proof cases for that purpose.Fingerprint Sensor : It does seems temperamental at times .Headphones : No Headphone Provided with devices and No Headphone Jack . Seriously heavy disappointment.Wireless Charging : Wireless Charging is a show off feature. We all know it's very slow but it does look good to flaunt.Weight : If you don't prefer Heavy phones , let this go . ONEPLUS 7pro is 200 gms and definitely feels heavy . Though I found  myself attracted to heavy phones .Review : If Best camera is priority  and you do tend to take underwater photography seriously, Spend 20K Extra for Huawei P30 Pro.OnePlus 7pro has a great camera , it's 3x zoom and bokeh is awesome . And is a great device , if you are looking for Good Camera , Super Cool Build and Best Performance.Speed is what OnePlus were really always selling here. This time they really went Beyond Speed.\n", "The phone is very good. Two weeks of usage and there is no problems with my unit. Camera is good, not awesome neither aweful as some reviewers advertised. Battery life is good but not great, the best part is the display that can be termed awesome. Overall a good phone to have but there are other alternatives if you are willing to go.Features:1. Flagship processor and built2. Awesome Display3. Good Battery life4. Good Camera performance (didn't expect to be good because of some biased reviews)5. Nebula is the new favourite6. Oxygen Os\n", "I bought this phone only for snapdragon 855 processor and all new 90hz display. I am satisfied with the display and the performance it provides. I don't use camera of any phone so my review will not tell about camera. But as I've seen with this phone camera quality is little bit average I'll say. This phone have some serious issues about the weight balance and absence of 3.5mm jack (adapter is not available also inbox ofcourse they want customers to spend valuable money on there brand). And non availability of 3.5mm adapter on official site is also a problem. Stereo speakers are also soo average.\n", "The phone is worth of money .I have seen on youtube they provide headphones and car dash charger with two extra cover.But i didn't get any of them totally disappointed with one plus team.If they are not giving such things then they should not show such things in their videos along with box .\n", "Product is awesome but delivery was delayed.the first thing you'll notice is that it is blazing fast. The camera pops up everytime for facial unlock which looks a little bothering somehow otherwise this phone is power packed. Battery life will go on for more than a day for me easily with daily chores on my phone as I am not a gamer.\n", "Just an amazing phone... I upgraded from Redmi Y2 and trust me guys...if you are upgrading from some 10-15k phone to this one... you'll surely love this device. The display is the best thing here, 90Hz refresh rate makes it so smooth to swipe... The phone no doubt is blazing fast..no lags or whatever seen till now. Some people were complaining about Ghost Touch or Pop up camera coming out while calling, we'll I haven't seen anything like that till now. These issues are present only on a very small no. of devices, so most probably you won't get a defective one...Dash charging is brilliant. Overall I think you should go for it. Don't see those camera reviews and all....OnePlus is improving them constantly...even I got a camera improvement update too...Soo I think it's the perfect phone under 50k\n", "I have been using OP7 Pro for last 7 days and I found performance of the phone, camera, battery live up to OP expectations until 7th days.  I witnessed a song app is playing music even after I killed all the process. As last step, I restarted the phone and to my surprise phone got stuck at restart for a minute or so without doing anything. After couple of minutes, I see screen going blank and photo just died. It won't start whatever you do. I finally found that this is a happening to many OP7 Pro phones and way to recover is pressing Power and Volume up key.Overall very disappointed . This has made me think if we should even trust and buy any more OP phone at all.I also found that once you purchase a phone through Amazon, it is not easy to return a defective phone. Even if you are still within 10 day return window, you cannot just ask for a replacement for defective phone. You have to spend good amount of time with Amazon customer service who will get a technician to visit you and find all ways not to accept the return which is very disappointing.So, firstly it is good to avoid this model till OP fixes this issue. If you still want to buy it, better buy it from retain stores and not online because you will be stuck with this product even if you don't want to.\n", 'This is my personal review after 2 days of usage and one thing is for sure , that this is the BEST DISPLAY ever, just like said at the event "FAST AND SMOOTH". Watching series/movies is a pleasing experience and hands on to One plus for that.The performance is smooth and amazingly fast as always with OP. They are Masters in this segment.I saw many comments on social media regarding the average battery backup, yes it is true but with WARP CHARGING it doesn\'t really matters. It is more than a balance to me. I won\'t mind burning more battery for a smoother experience which is new and missing with other brands.The biggest drawback I felt is the Camera. The pop up camera has got too much crop and if you open the video then you might end up shooting yourself only. The Rear camera too needs some optimisation which I am sure we will see soon.One thing which I want to bring in notice is the "NIGHTSCAPE" mode in Rear camera, it was working good before the first update and as soon I updated it , the quality went down. Same is with the normal one as well.One thing I felt which should have been given is the Type-C to 3.5mm jack cable, that was indeed missing. Rest everything is just perfect.Overall I will give it "4 stars out of 5". Deducted one because of the camera, was expecting a better one with OP7 pro atleast. I am optimistic that OP will come up with a strong solution soon. üññüññ\n', 'First have to give Amazon five stars for delivering this item on promised one-day delivery. Bought this phone as an replacement to my iPhone 6 (128 GB) & Coolpad note 3. My iPhone was draining battery in half a day; running basic call & messaging funcions slower.OnePlus 7 pro is an worthy replacement. My cousin recommended it. She bought for 53,000 approx; I bought for 4,000 RS less. It\'s fast, has edge to edge bigger screen; dual SIM and very long battery life. It runs PUBG as smooth as silk. Most wonderful of all is "Warp Charging". This makes my experience, just awesome.The latest update has changed cool airplane-mode animation (road appearing/disappearing). Loved that animation.The item was out for delivery@3:34PM; called the delivery man but call didn\'t go through; twice. The delivery was attempted @5:40, when no one was home. Delivery man called; I told him to re-attempt any time, same day, anytime 45min-1 Hr later. That\'s when he insisted that I collect from neighbor; I wanted it to collect in person, so I refused. He told me he\'ll deliver the next day; I refused.Through chat then in-app helpline call; was told delivery man was off duty. Then I gave an ultimatum that either the item be re- attempted or order be cancelled. Was ready to bid goodbye Amazon forever; deleting all saved cards, except the one for recovery of payment. Amazon personnel called back & resolved that deliveryman will re-attempt.Amazon really treats it\'s customers like A King. Made my experience with them awesome. This close to decision to never buying anything from Amazon again; this close to Amazon loosing a loyal customer for life. My loyalty to this brand of online shopping, became stronger due to customer- delight attitude of Amazon.Had bought a range of items from Amazon over the years; mostly electronics like headphones from leading brands like Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, etc phones like Coolpad note 3, iPhone 7, iPad 6th gen, Samsung M20, now OnePlus 7 pro. Love you Amazon. You are really A->Z (A through Z). This is the best online shopping experience ever.\n', 'Best budget smartphone in $700 price range. It is true to its class " the flagship killer". Only drawback i could find was that it is too large for single hand use  and battery consumption on daily usage although that can be justified by the presence of a 90hz display. Other than that a solid smartphone , feels premium in the hand with glass back and state of the art pop up selfie camera. I guess oneplus is living up to it\'s name and their motto "Never Settle".\n', "If there's one thing that caught my eye when my colleague bought this phone is the display. It was a stunning 2k+ Quad HD display after all. It then lead me to look for video reviews from the youtube experts. It turns out, they did appreciate the display and phone. It's amongst the best displays on a phone in recent times and it's a Samsung panel.Pros of this phone:1. Ultra smooth beautiful quad hd screen with a 90 Hertz display. It is 6.67 inches in size including the curved edges. It's great for social media,videos which can render in 1440p if available and for reading too. It also does not have a notch and you pretty much love it.2. Battery life with a 4000 MAH battery is great when you consider that you use a 90 Hz refresh vivid qhd screen. Your could switch to 60 Hz but nah. :)3. Back cameras do a good job in capturing pics. An yet to really test them. The front 16 mp pop up camera works well. It's a good camera setup.4. It's got the SD 855 processor and it's butter smooth and fast.5. With the oxygen OS, it delivers near stock Android experience. It will very soon be upgraded to 10.6. Warp charging: it's got crazy fast charging compared to op6 which I have before this and 90% will get your through the day and more.7. The on screen finger print sensor is great to use.Cons:1. It's a heavy phone at 200 grams. You will take a week to get used to it since we all are so adaptive.2. It's got a curved display with curved edges. Accidental Ghost touches do occur from time to time. Also, your need to be careful. If you drop it face down, it will fall on the screen side given its weight and with the curved edges, there is a chance to break.3. With the launch of the OP7t, One plus has diluted the significance of this phone. We Indians are price conscious and the OP 7t costs 7k lower than each of the OP 7 pro models even after prices dropped on the 7 plus pro (OP 7 pro costs 4k lesser than when launched 6 months ago).Update: just found that there's a One Plus 7t Pro launching on October 10th 2019. With it, this will be definitely be the undisputed OP Flagship.4. For the price, no type C to 3.5 mm jack connector in the box, no type C ear phones, no wireless charge, no waterproof certification but you do get a case.Verdict:If you want the great screen, FHD+ 2K+ display, 90 Hz refresh and notch less design, go for the one plus pro. If you want most of what pro has, a balanced phone, some additional features and are ok with the 2k display and notch screen design, go for One plus 7t which is a super budget flagship killer too.\n", "This is my first One Plus phone hence I don't  have a baseline to judge against.Pros:1. Excellent camera quality.2. It's a beauty to look at( P.S: I bought the Nebulae Blue).3. Display is just superb.(The resolution even when set to FHD+ and refresh rate of 60Hz is class leading).4. Snapdragon 855 is the fastest Qualcomm processor as of now so no knit picking in the speed and performance aspect.5. Price is perfect for all that you are getting.6. Selfie cam is better than I expected.Cons:1. The wide angle camera is a huge let down.(I have tried the S10+ wide angle lens setup and it's not comparable with this lens).2. No USB type C to 3.5 mm Jack adapter.( Another huge let down if you are used to getting earphones out of the box.)3. The QHD+ and 90Hz refresh rate drains charge fast and it's pretty obvious.4. At least a splash proof body could have been given at this price ( This is because splash proof displays and IP rated Samsung phones start around the 10 - 20K price range).\n", "Almost a week of use now and I'm loving it from every aspect. It's a flagship phone at a much lesser price than the other brands. Camera quality is superb and even night mode is great (only on the primary cam though, night mode doesn't work well in zoom/tele). It looks stunning, performance is superb and battery life is great even for a heavy user.\n", "Better than Samsung M30,A30,A50,A70,mi note 7pro, poco f1, vivo v15, oppo f11 pro, one plus 6t and all other middle(under INR 30000).Also better than iPhone 7, 7plus, 8, 8 plus, xr and upper middle priced phone(up to INR 60000).Also ignore all other brand phones.Points:1. Camera is excellent, night mode is brilliant2. No lagging at all3. No heating issue4. Comes with warp charger in box, super fast charging5. Front screen is the curved and totally premium look. 6.67in Fluid Amoled Display (2340 x 1440 pixels, HDR10+).6. No bending issue. Solid body.7. Sceen is not bleeding. No problem at all.8. Android pie (v9) with one of the most lightest skin Oxygen OS 9.5.3GM21AA (lots of customizations possible)9. No network issue (mobile network, wifi, screen casting)10. Little bit Slippery back side due to glass body. You can buy back cover for that. Also Silicon cover is come within box, if you like it.11. Popup camera is automatically lowered during free fall. ie. If you are using your phone with front camera poped up, and accidentally you drop you phone, front camera will be automatically goes back inside.12. No bloatwares (only Google apps(can not uninstal), one plus' 3-4apps(some of them can be uninstall) and Netflix(can not uninstall) are pre-Installed.I bought one plus 1 back in 2014. After that no phone attract me to buy it. But finally made my mind to buy this phone. And so far, no regrets at all.Jumping 6 generation(from one plus 1 to one plus 7pro) is fun.Hope you also like this phone.\n", "OnePlus 7 Pro - A Better Phone (As they say)OnePlus has revamped its phone completely. Whether its Screen, Processor, Camera, or even vibration motor.Here is my review for the phone.The Nebula Blue color looks amazing but it will be available from 28th May. So i got the Mirror Grey. Initial impressions are highly impressive. You don't get a phone in the boz. You get a massive screen. A huge 6.7' screen with no notch, no cutout, Just full screen. Viewing media on this beautiful gadget without any restriction is a great feeling.Pros:Quad HD+ Curved Display. Its massive, Its Quad HD, It have 90hz refresh rate, And yeah its beautiful Amoled.Dual Stereo Speaker with Dolby Atmos. Super loud sound clarity.Snapdragon 855. Faster than your blink.Camera. By far the best camera setup of OnePlus. I won't say its better than x y or z bt yeah its a flagship level quality. U can click awesome pictures with good details. Video stabilization is simply amazing as always OnePlusUFS 3.0 - Guys it is a mad thing. It makes the phone superfast. Transferring files like snap.Battery. Its 4000mAh guys.

After that when this defect is confirmed, I got my mobile on 2 nd day.. Thanks Amazon for responding so fast.After one successful replacement I finally got my phone. One plus 7 pro is one of it's kind. No comparison..... Video quality and stability mind blowing.... Camera quality decent... Touchscreen works like charm.... U will understand after using it.... Screen - OMG! really appreciate this approach.After having blazing fast processor and amazing fluid amoled screen i am pretty impressed that it stays long enogh ... Almost 18 to 20 hours... I playbpubg, watching videos on YouTube and Amazon prime.... Though its give very decent battery life....After 1 month of full usage I can say proudly that I am satisfied with this product. A bit disappointed on OnePlus for not adding the type C to 3.5 mm jack. But overall its a mobile worth of 50k....\n", "The Oneplus 7 Pro is a stunner. Gorgeous design. At the rear it had a 3 camera setup. All three work amazingly. The 3x telephoto actually helps and gives very clear pictures. The nightscape mode is the best I've seen till now. The results are stunning to say the least. Check the attached pictures. None of these have been reprocessed. The screen is smoother beauty. Full saturated colours and perfect. I'm not sure I'm fond of the curved screen though. The call quality and reception is perfect. The BT range of excellent. The 2 external speakers are unexpectedly, actually very good. The battery life is more than adequate. In my normal use its still at 70% in the evening. Like all the preceding Oneplus models this too is blazingly fast.If I have a grouse outs the automatic screen brightness. It's absolutely useless. It does nothing. My Oneplus 5t controlled brightness really well. Is this a deal breaker? Not one bit. This is the best mobile for me and the one that gives real bang for the buck\n", 'Excellent phone. Delight to see & hold in your hands.OnePlus has done an excellent Job - they picked all new funtions , new technologies (pop-up camera, curved screen, QHD dispy, on-screen finger print, 90 hrz etc. ) & added to this phone. - Intelligent approach.Has an excellent screen, 90 hrz is exceptional experience ( now when I use my older phone, it looks like sluggish)Very responsive finger print.

The phone is heavier than average, which has its own pros and cons.The BUTTONS and the VIBRATION motor give good feedback.The FINGERPRINT READER is fast and you won't notice the difference between the speed of a traditional and an on-screen one.I noticed that the phone was killing apps more than expected. It started killing apps after keeping 3-4 apps in the background (6GB version).Overall, very happy with this investment.\n", "If you want to buy a true flagship phone and don't care about brands, then buy it.

I'm getting a day and a half - 4 hrs Sot with 32-38 hrs or 7+ hours sot on weekends with a 18-22 hrs standby. Even it doesn't; You won't ever feel it. Charges in no time, Doesn't heats up while charging (even when you're using it). It's getting better after each day.Camera - Again, getting better after each update. I'm on android 10 open beta preview and you get all the features that you want. Every function enabled on each sensor. Default setting is great, detailed images, perfect balance. And, when you want to tweak, Pro mode is there. You don't need anything else when it comes to cameras. Btw, when comparing the pictures between S10 and 7 Pro, you'll like the 7 pro just cause of the display.Performance - Do I really need to review this? Just cut the animation scale to 0.5x in developer mode and it feels crazy. Not a single hiccup so far. This is the best performer in the industry.You won't get better experience than this. You may buy other flagships because you though the camers might be better or battery or blah blah. This the best thing in the market right now. Or, just wait for the 7T pro. 1 months maybe. Best thing ever.But, get a framless cover for 500, it will maintain the sleek feel of the phone. Don't try any uv screenguards, they are horrible. Use the stock screenguard or simple protectors.Cheers!\n", "It's a good phone I simply loved it the performance is awesome it's fast and smooth SD 855 rocks, the looks of the phone is great.

Battery drains fast\n', 'Hi All,Here below i have put some point about the One Plus 7 Pro (8GB RAM +256 GB storage) after using about 20 Days. I hope this will be informative for you.Pros1) It looks very stylish and slightly curved display is added beauty of this mobile.2) Display/Screen is large and give ultimate movie/video Experience3) I did use the 1+ 6 earlier as well so comparison to that it\'s far better than if i compare the sound quality. it Gives 3D sound effects4) Vibration intensity is quite good5) Charging speed is good, But to get the 100% charge it takes long time6) Rear Camera is very good, But Video/Image stabilization is less than one plus 6, and slow motion video requires high lights, capturing motion object is not good. but wide image capturing and day light shots still will not disappoint you.7) Front camera here is pop up camera so according to me for the selfie you do not need to clean Everytime... so i like it personally8) Storage is enough to handle your data9) Data transfer rate via cable or Wireles is fast, But also produce heat10) Finger Print is OK, I will not say bad but its not lightening fast11) overall it\'s good product will not disappoint you when you will go for thisCons Hardware is strong but there are some software problem which i face i will mention here... its not a show stopper but One Plus need to look into this.1) If you remember one plus 6 that gives alphabet reflection  "S" on its glass panels and it was added style... but One plus 7 they didn\'t provided that kind of reflection.... i am not happy with that2) No accessories like earphones with the box3) I purchased type C bullets earphone from one plus but it is not smooth to insert and move out from type C port4) Pre applied screen protector there is bubble in curved corner.. So i think  it will not work for me for long time :(5) Now come to the software isssue- Screen Auto Brightness is not well tuned- Rotation sensors is not work well some time you need to slap the mobile to work the same :(- Rotation sensors not works for all mode of example if you are looking some file from the file manager  and you want to horizontal look into that so that will not work- Supposed you have opened the WhatsApp and suddenly call come then you will not able to who is calling and what number its you need to click on that-When call is active in SIM 1 you will not receive mesg on SIM 2 , I faced this issue many time i used to disconnect the call to get that message- When i put my mobile in pocket and when i move out from my pocket it says to many wrong or incorrect Finger attempt kind of message.. so I guess may be pocket sensors is not there or i have not enabled some settings on it- There are many other software issue i observed which i faced i dont want to make this post lengthy by this so moving next-Screen recoder should work in background, but here it gives dot symbol, So what if i want to record activity on my mobile in hidden way ? there is no option6) Cover is good fited but to charge the mobile you need to move out  the plastic cover from type C port but after using 20 days shape has changed of that and its not covering any more type C port, then why they haven\'t cut that piece which is almost unused. its very annoying to see that pieceNote : These above software issue points should not stop you to buy this product... These are minor problem that can be rectified by newer updateand i want to appriciate and wish good luck to One Plus and it\'s team for this product. Such a nice product.\n', 'This is an awesome phone so far. The camera, Warp Charge, the battery, screen, dolby sound, are really awesome.Only one thing that was to worry is the absence of 3.5 mm jack, but that is covered by warp charge.

I don't know if I can ever go back from this screen to any other device now.The processing speed is really really good.It doesn't slow down when it is dying in battery or if 4-5 apps are running in parallel. Processing is just flawless.When I was buying this phone, I was continuously told that camera is something u won't like. However, to my surprise till now the images taken are just amazing.Really love the portrait mode and wide angle feature on this. So amazing.Overall mobile feels really premium in your hands.Must recommended buy if this comes under your budget.\n", '\xa0Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus.

It's 'For your eyes only '.CHARGE- it's 'warping' fast I charge my phone at 5% mark and 30 minutes later it is 65 % so the One plus did good on the promise . The brick is beast of a charging plug.REFRESH RATE - ITS 90 Hz or nothing that's how fantastic that refresh is . 60Hz doesn't disappoint either  , the difference between the two is not too much but you definitely feel surfing a wave while sliding down and up it'll be a whole new time pass .lolCAMERA- nightscape mode and normal photo mode are super cool crisp and subtle pics to impress anyone . The pop up selfie camera gives a clean and cool selfie . So pop it like you work itOthers- no heating issues did play pubg on 90 Hz and qhd lasted me 3.5 hrs on what was the best pubg experience thus far . The only reason i reinstalled pubg after quitting it last year was to check the limits of the specs offered by the phone and it superceded it in everyway possibleCONS-BATTERY- 90 Hz and qhd will take a toll on your phone .battery life is disappointing kind of but given high end specs you get at this price plus the warp charge I think the company made its warp charging knowing that .With high end spec it lasts about 4-5 hrs extensive use like gamingWith 90hz and fhd about 5-6 he extensive to moderate use .60 hz and fhd -5-7.5 hrs with extensive to moderate useHANDLING-depends on your hands me being a 6'3 didn't find it difficult at all.CAMERA- even after the update the portrait mode is disappointing depth effect has played a spoil sport .NO DONGLE(SCREW YOU ONE PLIS FOR THAT ;). )NO HEADPHONE JACK (DOUBLE SCREW YOU)Overall go for it just the best experience this flagship has to offer in range of 49k to 53 k .NOTE - DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS ON THE SCREEN THAT IS THERE BY DEFAULT IT IS THE BEST ONE YOU'VE GOT FOR A LONG WHILE WILL DO JUSTICE\n", "The phone is super amazing.. It is a little heavy compared to other models from One Plus but that's not a complaint as the phone is real fast with great and simple features.. The finger print scanner is not that great as most of the times I have to input my password due to lockage from trying several times. I think they need to work a lot on this.. Camera quality is super good and even the night pictures turn out to be fabulous.Has a great battery life.. Based on my usage I'm getting around 12-15 hours.. But I need not to worry as the phone charges super quick.!Initially there were a few call drops but I think the issue is fine now..The best part about the phone is it's speakers! Dolby surround is just out of the World and you get a theater experience while watching videos or even music for that matter..OnePlus could have provided some basic headphones with this phone as it does not have a jack..

Great service. I received and installed 2 updates, and having used it for a week plus, I can say it's been a mixed experience. Some features work well, others dont. So here's my impression for you.Good:1. Large and sharp LED screen with good legibility. Watching videos is fun. The on screen FP sensor is fast and conveniently located, no delays or misses.2. Dual speakers with clear sound, though music quality through speakers is just about OK.3. Fast and zippy, be it apps, games or file transfers. Doesnt get hot while playing games or charging4. Really fast charging. Fully charged in an hour!5. Oxygen OS is minimal and easy to use. The popup selfie camera is quicker than I expected.6. Haptic feedback is very refined. I used to turn it off on phones. On this one, it's on.The bad:1. The curved edges make it more slippery and the image on the edges reflect and appear distorted, any element there is hard to touch. Collects fingerprint marks easily. I dont find the missing notch makes any huge difference in my usage.2. There is no headphone socket on the phone, no USB-C headphone or adapter in the box3. The selfie camera is average, The rear triple camera setup isnt great as advertised. The main camera is good but gives inconsistent results.The Ugly1. Handling the phone because of it's weight, size and top heaviness, slipperiness.2. Battery life is a shame for a 4000mAh. Bringing down refresh rate and screen resolution made it a bit better, but it's still a one day phone at best.3. Wide angle lens is low on detail, not too wide yet creates distortion4. Not VFM at this price. Its should have been 6-8k cheaper for that.My impression is, this is a phone that only huge screen lovers should go for. The rest should wait for OP7, check if its battery life isnt as bad as this, and go for 8/256 version, still saving 11k over oneplus 7 pro. Else wait for s10/s10+ discount sale. I regret I didnt wait for S10 to be discounted.\n", "With standard use the phone simply died within a month form purchase. Something that you don't expect with a 52k flagship. I have logged a ticket with support and only the resolution they provide may help change the rating..\n", "though the phone is heavily loaded but there are certain things which it lacks and is required by most of the common users. having a high camera setup the phone still gives you an ok image which when compared to other flag ships is way less quality wise. i felt for such high end phones 4000mah battery is less, though 7 pro gives you decent 1 and half day back up on normal usage but same back gets reduced to a day or less on extensive usage. last but the most important is the head phone jack,  i was expecting one plus would provide c to 3mm jack connector like they did in case of one plus 6 and 6t. strange thing is they don't have enough inventory of the same.\n", "The phone is a beast. I switched for iPhone to one plus. Not sure if you'll find a phone this fast and smooth. The 90hz is a treat to scroll through, you will feel the difference after using this phone and then switching to a different phone with a basic 60hz. The experience is just wonderful. The fingerprint even though is fast it's not necessarily consistent you'll sometimes need to keep trying to unlock the phone and the camera is decent at most, does the job most of the time. Video watching experience is absolutely wonderful, great battery life, you can expect a whole day even with considerable usage.

Good looking large screen - fun to use a truly full screen phone.2. Overall build of the phone is great - thought it would be too heavy (200gm) to use but it is not so.3. Battery does hold up for up to 1.5 days on a single charge (I'm a moderate user)4. Camera is decent. I currently switch between GCam and Default camera apps depending on what I'm shooting. Better to have both installed and available for your use.Cons:Again, the news holds true.1. Ghost touches: The issues reported on ghost touches does occur. But this happens only occasionally, does not bother you much.2: Weak speaker - when set to Max phone volume, it's feels less pleasant to hear. Must ensure that it is not set at full volume.3.

I WENT TO ONE PLUS SERVICES STATION THEY SAID THEY CAN'T DO ANY THING I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW.\n", "I bought OnePlus7 pro 8GB/256GB Nebula Blue on 13th June and upgraded (yes upgraded) from OnePlus5, which I used for almost 2.5 years. Before that I was using OnePlus1, So I am part of OnePlus community for almost past 5 years. Therefore, I have witnessed the journey of OnePlus in India from the beginning. Let's get into the details:1. Display - Amazing display with Fluid AMOLED and 90 Hz refresh rate. It is way better than OnePlus5 and OnePlus6 also. I haven't compared it with 6T. After using this phone for almost 2 weeks, I feel OnePlus5's display is dull and lifeless.2. Sound - The Dolby Atmos speakers are the best I have ever experienced in any phone. I compared the same with both OP5 and OP6 and there is a significant improvement in sound quality. The phone has speakers on both the sides but 85% sound comes from the bottom one.3. Battery Life - I haven't used the phone for extensive gaming; with moderate level of gaming (2 hrs.) and 3-4 hrs of screen time and 1.5 hrs of calling time it would easily give you 24 hrs. For cricket lovers, a full charge of phone will give you 70-75 overs with 70% volume.4. Camera - It is far better than OP5 and OP6, especially the low light clicks, but it could have been better for this price.5. Performance - I have never faced any problem with the performance of any OP phone and I am sure this phone will surpass your expectation.Downsides:1. It is very heavy compared to OP5, 206 gm, you'll feel the weight in your pocket2. There is no 3.5 mm earphone/headphone audio jack3. There is single type c jack for both audio and charging4. The finger print sensor is not as fast and smooth as the previous versions, but it has improved significantly after 2 system updates provided by OP. I hope it'll improve further with future updates5. The face unlock is quick but not quick like earlier phones, because of pop up front cameraThere are some teething problems, which I think we face with every new smart phone these days. I think, it would be sorted with future system updates. Overall, it is an incredible product from OnePlus and certainly the best one ever offered by them.

Fingerprint sensor is still fast, camera is still awesome and the speed is still a no lag experienceP.S. m not paid for this review, its just that you have to own a one plus to know what it can really do\n', 'I have bought one plus 7 pro two days ago. This is the best product One Plus has made till date. I have bought 12 GB RAM and 256 GB storage.First of all I must thank Amazon for a wonderful delivery commitment. The day I ordered next day delivery however, it was too much rainy day. Hats off.I have given 4 star ideally should have given 4.5 out of 5 but no fractional marking.Pros...-Wonder physical look both back side dual tone nebula blue and front display really good with smooth flow over the edges. Also no non-sense notch. üëçüëç-State of the art processor snapdragon 855, 48 MP Sony camera ( triple) stunning AMOLED display.-Picture quality specially rear is good.-Battery average to good with high resolution display and 90Hz refresh rate and large display,  battery should have been 4500 mAH. Hope they will correct in 7T Pro.-Sound quality stereo speakers good.Cons...-Finger print reader requires full finger coverage not touch and go type which was a case for my earlier Honor View 10.-Biggest disappointing is that such a high quality product but such a cheap plastic cover? Such things are acceptable for 25k product not from a product have values nearly 60k.- No ear phone or even a type C to 3.5 mm converter. That I have ordered from Amazon. Hence could not experience real quality of listening to music.- No cleaning micro cloth- The charger is so big it covers the next socket area on switch board and when this phone is getting charged I cannot use next socket.-Selfie experience is not good, photos get heavily distorted on edges.- 206 gm a bit heavy on shirt pockets should have been below 200gms.- No expandable memory my old micro sd is now useless.- 12GB RAM does not give extra storage on devices, exactly do not know why 8GB and 12 GB cost difference is 6k. Samsung gives higher storage with higher RAM.\n', 'First of all this phone is value for moneyThe camera quality is phenomenalExcept for the front camera performance in dark confition is very poorThe finger print scanner is not that accurateThe battery life is very goodBest battery in any smart phoneThe display is greatPotrait mode is avgNight scape mode is amazingBetter than s10 plus in all aspectsIf you are confused btwn note 10 pls and op7proGo for op7pro\n', 'I just brought it 15days ago and one plus 7T got released with same features and 20000 less price and it has fallen from just 35cm and screen got broken.\n', "Very nice phone OnePlus 7 ProI liked the lookI liked the cameraI liked the body colour nebula blueBattery could be better because it decreases with full features onIf you play games it will drain moreBut for normal daily use also battery is not enough at 90 hz.

Will have to take it to service center\n", "I have purchase 8 GB varient on 24-06-19 and within 3 or 4 days I found following defects :-1. Battery backup is very poor. It drains very fast.2. OnePlus claimed super strong conactivity, but according to me it is only satisfactory.3. Cost of this product is very high.4. I contacted customer care within 4 days of purchase for replacement. But they refused.So guys if you want to purchase costly phone. Think deeply about the negetive side. So please read all customers reviews carefully and then finalise. Once product received, you can't do anything.\n", 'Well, there is nothing to dislike about this device. I own the 8GB Ram version of OnePlus7Pro. But, OnePlus could‚Äôve delayed the launch of OnePlus7TPro. Within a couple of months, your phone is no longer the flagship even though the device was launched less that 3 months ago of my purchase.Note:1. Camera is above average but not among the flagships of other brands.2. Display is amazing. I‚Äôve not experienced anything like it before.3. Just received an update for Android 10.4.

Sometime feels like the touch is not working and suddenly after 10-15 sec or more, the phone goes into calling mode.3) Voice disturbances-many instances, when the call is made, voice is not transmitted.4) CAMERA- even after the update the back camera is still blurred. Indoors it take decent photography but not up to the mark of a flagship killer (as these are called). The focus is bad. In potrait (depth) mode background is not blurred.I have been following OnePlus community forums and these problems are common all across. Also different people are getting different issues.Would really like to get money back. But the option for refund or replacement wasn't available initially and now it shows refund period closed on 30th may. Looks like a cheap stunt to force the products on the consumers.\n", "Display is the best in the marketright now, fingerprint reader is as fast as you can imagine, games like pubg are extremely smooth and graphics are absolutely amzing. Oxygen os is just so amazing and easy to use and it's extremely fluid. Battery life depends on how much you use the phone really , if you use camera a lot or play lot of pubg then it won't last for a day otherwise you're good to go for one day. My only complain is the camera. In this price of phone you expect really good camera. Unfortunately that's not the case. Camera is just average. Selfie pop up camera looks really cool and catches some attention and its better than the main camera. Nightscape is just a gimmick. So other than the camera , everything else is just perfect.\n", "Switched from iPhone 7 and love it. The phone is super fast and the display is amazing. Love the reading mode.

One plus must work on these issues...\n', 'One plus is moving towards premium segment pricing. But gone all those days were Oneplus was flagship killer.

It's just a perfect phone in all aspects. Every spec including hardware and software is awesome. Display,design,camera , sound everything meet my expectations.\n", "I waited patiently for a month to buy the Almond edition and by god it was worth it. The beauty of this variant is very difficult to capture in photos, it really needs to be felt first hand.Coming on to the device itself, it is a monster, in every way. The battery is pretty good, fingerprint sensor works most of the time, vibration motor is amazing, 90 hz is the Trump card. Everything about this phone is spectacular except:The fact that OnePlus have decided to skip the headphone adapter in the box. I covered myself in this regard by buying it before the phone itself but it has been out of stock ever since. There is no reason to omit it from the box.OnePlus has said that it is splash proof, but an official IP rating would have been nice.I don't use wireless charging but for a phone that costs 50k, it should have been there. But I understand OnePlus' point of view that it is better to do it properly.Wide angle video missing, coming as a future update, portrait mode uses telephoto lens.Overall the best phone you can lay hands on.\n", "My first OnePlus phone and it's awesome. There is little weight that you might feel. Charging is super fast, you will never conplain about it. Camera quality is not that great as per its price but beauty is they are continuously pushing updates to make it even better. It's smooth. I don't play games at all so gamer u have no idea wabiut would you look in a phone. Battery backup is awesome. Just one concern, OnePlus needs to push security updates on time. Like it was already end of June when we got May 1st security patch. Gcam works perfect without doing any alteration in the system. Nughtscape is kind of ok till this update when I'm writing it. What else left? Yeah just one more thing, it feels little costly, but would give you great feeling of not owning that cheap version of crap which would merely last an year.

But after 2 weeks of full fledged use, this is my verdict. Overall usage of phone is good. Its smooth in operation, fast in processing. But i did not get the feel of the Pricetag it had..Camera: After using the Samsung Note series for almost  6 years, i was very dissapointed in the Camera.. Though they claim a higher PPi, the clarity of the photos are that pathetic for a long distance shoot as compared to a lower version of a Galaxy phone..Battery is not that great but better than Samsung. But still need to see how long that goes. maybe i will have to review again after 3-5 months of use on the battery part..As a brand i feel that Oneplus is too confident now that they have acquired a steady market now and they feel that now they can start cheating the customers.. For this hefty price - there is not even a headphone, the 6+T atleast came with a supporting cable for the Aux, 7+pro didnt even have that.. I still wonder whats the reason for this price tag..I Should have gone for the Iphone XR..This is my biggest mistake i have ever done in purchasing a phone over the years..

Worst service by op service\n', "The display is the key point which outrage this phone. I just brought this phone for it's display. It feels too smooth & the 90Hz display is way better than u think. Since it's a curved display & huge display with no notches on it you have to be a bit careful in handling it. If you are a bit rough handler then you need to think twice before buying, but if you are a soft user as me then if budget is not a constraint then this is the right phone at this price point.\n", 'Amazing in every possible way. While everything is top notch quality, the screen is just mesmerising and completely notchless. Loving every bit of it.\n', "I ordered as soon as was available. The phone looks beautiful, feels premium. The letdown begins when u start using it for a while. The fingerprint reader was easy enough to setup. But upon usage had issues. it didn't work all the time. Lots of time the phone would just keep saying too many attempts & keep asking for pin. The pop up camera started having weird rubbing noise Everytime it was used.the phone calls had weird static distortion in them while they were quite clear on my iphone. I think they will release an update to fix it. The edges of the screen with the curve e resistance to touch and since the corners of the screen r more rounded than others, lots of time functionality was cut off. Like the voice message button in WhatsApp. The screen looked great with the 90hz display but unresponsiveness killed all the fun. It dosent matter if the screen is good . It might have a higher refresh rate but will still feel slow if the responsiveness is low. The camera quality was the most dissapointing aspect. Coming from iPhone the difference was quite apparent. The images seemed more granier and more saturated. The 3x zoom is underwhelming. Will probably install the pixel camera software as the stock software just dosent match up. But then the pixel phones have the best camera processing in the smartphone world.The battery is fine not great, but that was to be expected with the quad hd 90hz display. Roughly lasts 8to 9 hrs on average usage for me. Warp charge is a boon.Overall the price increase for the pro version does not seem to be justified. Too many trade-off. The one plus 7 which is not getting as much attention is a much better phone and more value for money. The difference in value proposition seems negilible between the two.\n", "I am diehard fan of one plus but this time I was disappointed coz of its camera quality even..one plus 5 has better camera quality than it..  pop selfi camera is also not good ..the picture are blurred after captured...it's battery is not good as previous phones coz it's drained fastly...nd also disappointed for headphones jacks...or even in the time of unboxing u shown there are Bluetooth headset but I didn't get any headset..u should provide headset with phone when we paid 50 k...\n", "Screen : It's really awesome.. 90Hz is silky smooth..Charging Speed : It does charge 50% inside 20 mins..Battery Life : 1.5 - 2 Days battery life for my usage..

They are loud but not clear(Maybe it can be improved by changing the some setting or solve it in the next updates)My review : Overall i loved the phone.. If you are a normal usage phone person, then you will definitely love the phone b'coz of its 90Hz screen.. Some user will change the display setting to 60Hz, but if you start using it on 90Hz then there no way you will go back to 60Hz..Pros : As per my usage..#1 - If you use it for 30 mins and then take some another phone, you will not like the other phone.. You will fall in love with the display and once you start using it daily, you will not touch any other phone..#2 - Phone has a 1440 x 3120 pixels resolution and huge screen size, so if you watch a lot of content on your phone, You will love it..#3 - Performance is really fast..#4 - Definitely whole day battery life.. (1.5 day for me)Cons : As per my usage..#1 - As the screen size is huge, it is very difficult to use the phone in one hand.. You cannot type while chatting with one hand..#2 - Finger print sensor - I keep my phone inside my bag while driving, the screen wakes up so many times.. Accidental screens wakes up a lot..(Hope they solve this issue in next updates)#3 - Sometimes some apps do crash..

That flamboyant display with a cheeky 90hz is something ppl say is not noticable...Trsut me the absolute feel of that is beautiful.Gaming is undeniably the best from the best in this segment.Camera is great with the patches all of its issues are fixed and going forward many more patch updates will hopefully just make it better.. Stabilization is on point. The audio captured on the videos is great quality.Speed is absolutely is blazing fast... Yes it is going to face a challenge from the likes of redmi k20 pro. But it is a one plus end of the day and am 100% sure display is where k20 pro is not going to win.

The video is as smooth as butter and you can somehow tell the difference between when it's running at 60Hz refresh rate and 90 Hz refresh rate. The 90 Hz refresh rate just feels much much cleaner and more absorbing. It is actually hypnotizing that's how good this phone is. You can use it for gaming and the visuals will be mind altering altogether. I was just playing Modern Combat 5 and wow what a mind bending experience it is. You can actually place yourself in the thick of battle with the chaos all around you. I have also played other games like temple runner etc. and they run like butter. Overall, very very very happy with this amazing phone and highly recommend it to anyone for any purpose whatsoever.\n", "It is not a good product as we expected it is not Reaching the expectations it is one of the worst phone in its battery and by paying a large amount the finger print doesn't work properly and there was no response for our issue till 15 days still now no response was thereThe display will get lagged like hell\n", 'You cannot  distinguish between a screen off and black wall paper .

Also bit on a heavier side.. you will get used to it though.Performance wise its definitely top of the evolution chain.If you want top of the line fast phone this one is for you.

All doubts cleared though as i have been using it since last week.I have cut one star because i believe it can improve further on camera and fingerprint sensitivity as well as few tweaks in software (like u cant seperately lower down notification volume); otherwise, it is a phone to have in 50k range!\n', "I am writting this review after extensively using this phone for more than two weeks. Let's divide it in pros and cons.Pros-1- One of the best feature of this phone is it's Display.  It's Quad HD display is one of the best in the market and at par with the likes of S10, iPhone series.2- The curved display gives a brilliant overall premium look and practicality to this phone. The curve is so subtle that it kind of flows in the phone and gives you a better grip.3-  90hz refresh rate is like you slipping I'm butter. It's is so smooth that you will feel odd using other mobiles. You can feel the difference as soon as you pick this phone.4- After the camera update all bugs are gone now and the picture quality you are getting at this price is brilliant and on par with likes of Samsung and iPhone. You just have to change the camera settings to get the best out of it. There are 1000 plus videos to guide you through it.5- Stereo Speaker, A person who has used One plus before will understand what a drastic improvement one plus has done on sound quality. It's is loud, it's is crisp and any audiophile will like it.6- Call quality. Cellular call quality and reception is good with this phone. There is no lag or anything with this device.7- Built quality- The phone is premium looking, well built beast. No flaws or air gaps you can find and it gives you an confidence when you hold it in your hands.Cons-1-  First I have to right this. There are so many reviews for this phone giving 1 star and stating that they have seen on YouTube that it comes with a headphone and they didn't receive it. I mean this  is heights of stupidity guys. Firstly, in description only it is clearly mentioned what all comes with the phone and secondly youtubers get a review unit which is totally different from a retail unit. One cannot judge a phone on this particular thing.2- Battery- So you have a big battery here and with a moderate to heavy media use it will last you to 12-14 hours.This includes 2-3 hours callingSocial media consumptionStreaming sites consumption ( as World Cup in going on and we want India to win)So, battery will give you above average use but it is definitely not bad. Morey, one can change the 90hz refresh rate setting to 60hz and Qhd to Hd setting if you want more battery life, but again what's the fun here.3- 3.5 mm headphone jack- So I was one of guys who was really disappointed with this move of removing 3.5 mm jack. But, after getting this phone I got good Bluetooth headphone and I understood that what I was missing. Sound quality wise the opinion is divided among people as some say you get better sound quality over Bluetooth and some say it is better with 3.5 mm headphone jack. But, the kind of freedom you get with wireless device is way way better. And after you get a wireless earbuds or headphone you will understand that it is way better than wired ones. So, personally this is not a con for me now.4- weight- Phone is definitely heavy when you compare to other phones. But, you will get use to it. And after some time you will feel more confident with the weight of this phone while handling. It is not an issue.Conclusion- So one plus was a brand which use to kill the flagships of the year and now it has created a flagship of its own. We should understand this that usually a flagship phone which we get from Samsung or Apple at 70-80k, here we are getting it for 50k. This phone gives you all the premium features at a lesser price than its competitors.So, if you have a budget of around 50k. You should go for this phone without even thinking twice definitely it's flagship of the year with the price point it comes. Just go for it guys!!!!!!\n", "Lets not start a paragraph & jumping into pros & cons :PRO'S ;Screen : The screen is really impressive & the slight curved edges are adding an awesome impression every time you look at the display .Speed : It has 0 lag . Currently I am using op7 pro 8Gb variant & it runs without any lag till now .Have played games like pubg & asphalt but it runs smooth & fast without any issues .Also no major heating issues has been observed even after running pubg for more than 2 hours .Camera : Its a next generation camera which I have not experienced before . The low light images are mind blowing & can compare with any DSLR . The AI camera quickly adopts to any scene automatically & switches its mode . Landscape photography even at night seems pretty awesome .The front camera is pretty much realistic & will give a genuine image without much beauty or skin smoothing effect . (Those can be added externally if you wish) .Fingerprint / Face unlock : Works more than fine .Battery : Really awesome . gives around 6 hours of Screen on time with constant FB / Messenger / insta / you tube stream / 2 hrs of pubg on high graphics . Without gaming you can have 8 hours of S.O.T without any doubtAdd on : It has horizon lightning instead of notification LED . Every time you receive a notification the edge will glow up . It looks quite premium & stylish .Delivery & packing : Within a single day without any issue .CON'S :The phone is quite heavy compared to my previous one plus 5 . It really pains the fist if you grab it single handed for long time as its 208 gm . (Still you can manage it I believe as its not a thor's hammer ).No notification LED . Instead of that ambient display & horizon lightning is there but still i prefer the edge old notification LED .No 3.5 mm jack . You can buy a type c to 3.5 mm converter spending 250 rs more from Amazon  .No more cons . Overall its a performance phone with a premium look , holding it you can stand out of the crowd & can make yourself an attraction point :)\n", 'This is my first one plus phone..I bought this phone for display,speed,storage.. I am satisfied with all these three things..added advantage is a camera..over all the infinite display is awesome,speed is super and storage is 256gb..Love this phone..Battery charging is faster..it has warp charging feature..once charged can use for a day..I will give 3.7/5 for  battery..\n', "Bought this phone for my sister. As expected this is an amazing phone and has every feature one could expect. Battery life is almost a day (sometimes even more). Camera clarity is amazing. One thing I didn't like about this series is that OnePlus hasn't released tempered glass for it yet and every other tempered glass is just not good enough.\n", "Mobile is excellent and display is superb... I can't find much difference between 90Hz and 60Hz refresh rate.. battery is draining Very fast ..one plus must work on it.pop up camera is awesome..for face unlock it unlocks with in a blink even we cant find the camera moving up and going inside..back camera OnePlus claims 48 MP , but images taken are same as one plus 6t cam . which is 20mp...finally one can go for one plus 7 Pro if they are affordable for 50k bucks , one who wants to enjoy popup camera..display is really super .\n", "The phone definitely looks great due to its big screen, 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. But it sincerely lags in Camera department even after updates. Video Recording, Voice Recording are great but i am not sure for some reason pics from its front camera just looks average and lacks true colors. Infact, my previous phone Redmi Note5 Pro used to click better selfies. Battery drains quickly if you use 90Hz refresh rate and QHD+ display. Luckily, it has a warp charging adapter with it. Although, the phones gives you premium feel at a premium price but One Plus should look into the Camera Software updates. It's no where near to that of Pixel, Note series or Huwaei premium phones in terms of camera. Except for camera, this phone is a rockstar.\n", "It's extraordinary, only thing which is lagging when compared to Apple and pixel phones is camera. Nonetheless camera are also really good. Not to mention batter life is also good but not spectacular. Major pros of this phone are Display, performance, software, build quality and charging speed which is on another level. Over all very satisfying experience with this product. Well done OnePlus ! And I still miss the headphones jack !\n", 'Review after eight days of heavy use:Blazing fast.Fabulous screen.No heating.Transfer 25 GB of data from leptop in just 15 minutes .ConsBit heavy and uncomfortable for one hand use.Except it definitely buy it\n', "Writing this review after 1.5 monthSo guys the 90hz screen the best part you will definitely call in love with it from the day one it's buttery smooth with sd 855 man it's a beast playing HD games feels great on this phone.Charging is also fast ever morning I plug my device and I get my device all juiced up before leaving office in about an hour.Although it has no 3.5 mm headphone jack but you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy the c type bullets available at OnePlus website (they are awesome) or but the connector available at OnePlus website, so stop making a fuss about 3.5 mm jack (u are spending around 50k here, go buy a decent headphone too).Camera after the updates improved a lot and now pictures are quite good, still there are some issues with lowlight photos but in proper light the photos are good. Front camera selfie is also good no issues with that.Overall a nice phone, a bit overpriced (after looking at the price of k20 pro üòõ) but yes it's still the flagship killer and way better than many of it's competitors.\n", 'I am going to write a short review...The packaging and the delivery was fast got the product 2days before delivery date..thanx to amazon.Coming to the product,For me the screen which is quad hd display along with 90hz refresh rate was the main reason i choose the phone.. Display(9.5/10)Battery backup depends on the purpose you are using the phone for, for heavy usage it should last around 7 hours and in light to medium usage it should last for a whole day.. Battery(7.5/10)Camera is the weakness that one plus devices have been facing the most..but thanx to the software updates and good software optimisation the camera is now good although if you are looking for a camera centric phone this is not the phone u are looking for.. Camera(7/10)Special Note- This is not the best phone but with all the hardware and software optimisation this is the perfect balance that one plus has achieved and i must say that the display only is enough to blow you away...hope this helps you.\n', 'I think best phone in #2019 from One plus. I also exchange my one plus 6 to one plus 7 pro blue colour 12gb ..  I can tell it with 100% believe that you can choose it to close you eyes\n', "Almond colour is a showstopper, OnePlus has indeed showcased their masterpiece in terms of overall built (perfection). The in-display fingerprint reader is insanely fast, in my opinion it's on par with traditional one's. Yes, the camera could use some work but I feel it's nothing an OTA can't fix (at least the hardware is strong to handle future fixes). The game changer for OnePlus is the DISPLAY, it is just gorgeous with QHD and 90hz panel (a visual treat indeed). Last but not the least, performance from the core chipset and the delivery by oxygen OS is right where you'd expect SUPERIOR. Gaming, scrolling through apps, movies, songs everything is just so different on OnePlus 7 pro. I really can't imagine going back to a regular 60hz panel anymore. Excellent job OnePlus, we are now a true Flagship Killer!!!\n", "I didn't find anything that appreciable in this phone other than it's premium look..I have been using this phone since 3 months and I can say that buying this device is really a waste of money. The scenario becomes more worst due to its poor backup and fast battery draining..could you believe that it's battery dropped to 20% from 70% in just one and a half hours. I needed to charge this phone multiple times a day, the wrap charger gives some relief for it charges super-fastly. If I talk about it's camera quality, it is just average..often the pictures get blurred and I don't understand why the hell it is so.. Absence of ear-phone jack makes the situation more worse. Finger sensor too often not works..I needed to put finger 3-4 times then it recognizes the finger..I haven't expected such a low from one plus, a higher version should have greater experience ..but such a premium phone in such a premium price has been proved a waste of money..I m really disappointed with this phone..\n", 'Simply the best deal in the Android world right now.

The primary camera comes with 16MP, but the resolution is not as expected. The selfies taken by MI is far better then the one captured by this phone. The One Plus brand should take this feedback very seriously and try to fix it up by providing some updated camera software updates.Very much disappointed as far as camera is concerned.The package lacks the Type C USB to audio jack converter. The One Plus should take up this feedback and include the one in the pack.As far as battery back up is concerned, it is very good. Luckily I did not get carried away by other reviews on Amazon :).\n', 'Camera quality has been improved drastically over the last few updates.The device feels premium.The indisplay fingerprint is preety fast.The warp charge is very quick and oxygen is feels smooth as butter.Preety good deal for the price if comes to S10+ which cost around 70k mark.\n', "A killer flagship !!Display is out of the world with this 90hz panel.

It could get me to a full charge in an hour.Finger print reader is pretty accurate and also the pop up face unlock is a head turner.Audio quality,Call quality,Video quality,Ram management,Network Coverage all are as expected and is perfect.The camera is kind of good, I mean the primary 48mp and the 16 mp pop up camera are great to use, but the wide angle and telephoto do need a lot of improvements. The portrait mode could also be a bit improved.The battery is not terrible, but should carry around the charger if travelling for a day.The phone is pretty huge and heavy, but don't know if that's much of a big deal.Overall a futuristic smartphone with pretty descent value for money. I definitely bought this device over the regular one plus 7 for the screen and it's obviously worth it.
