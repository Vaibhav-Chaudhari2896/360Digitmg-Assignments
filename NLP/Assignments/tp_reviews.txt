["It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.The story is somehow easier to follow than in the last adaptation, motives and actions are easier to see and follow. I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.", 'Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible for decades, to write and direct a faithful adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. And I\'m here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. And to this day, it\'s one of the best stories I\'ve ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn\'t enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than Lynch ever could. But on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.From reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven\'t read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. It\'s kind of how they did it with "the lord of the rings" trilogy.But, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. I\'ve seen it in IMAX twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. It\'s epic in every meaning of the word. And all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.The actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn\'t get enough screen time.This movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second IMAX viewing, i felt that Villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. But that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could\'ve dived deeper into the lore. Two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. And with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.But that being said, I had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. I\'ve been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. And still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made DUNE. It\'s finally here, it\'s gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it\'s two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it\'s still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic CGI and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. It\'s most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he\'s a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. We need part 2, we need it badly. This story deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template.', "It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.", 'There is probably no point in warning about spoilers for this film. You\'ve probably read the book or seen either the 1984 Dino DeLaurentis version or the 2000 Sci-Fi mini-series.... If you\'ve seen either one of those, you\'ve seen this movie. This movie only covers half the story, the sequel we\'ll probably never get to see will cover the other half.So how does it stack up? Not well, in my opinion. It\'s a loud, dull action movie, with an ear-splitting soundtrack. It has all the scenes you might have seen if you watched either of those two versions, but didn\'t do them nearly as well.At two and a half hours, it drags on. The Lynch version of the film was 137 minutes, and got the whole story in. This film leaves key aspects out, and only tells half the story, and it just goes on and on and on.To start, let\'s talk about characters. DeLaurentis got a cast of largely unknowns back then, many of whom went on to distinguish themselves. Kyle MacLachlin, Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, Sean Young. Heck, even the little girl actress, Alicia Witt, went on to have a career as an adult. This movie uses a cast of people you\'ve heard of, and their screen time is often based on "I know who that is." Other characters, more critical ones, were kind of shuffled to the side.I\'ll give two examples. A key point in the book is that the betrayal by Dr. Yeuh, (played here with no charisma by Cheng Chen) because as a Suk Physician, taking a human life is against his conditioning. No build up, no nothing, he just does it.On the other hand, because Duncan Idaho is played by Jason Momoa, he gets a lot more screen time than his presence in the book. (Duncan\'s clones become a much more important part of later books, but that\'s neither here nor there.) His final fight scene goes on interminably here, while they were quickly brushed over in the previous versions.Similarly, while Peter DeVries is a key player in the book, here they don\'t even mention him by name, and he\'s just "Henchman who gets poisoned". Other characters are omitted altogether, including Emperor Shaddam, Princess Irulan and Feyd Ruatha. Concepts such as the Mentats, Guild, Bene Geserit, are kind of glossed over to get to those sweet, sweet action sequences.The movie rises and falls on the actor who plays Paul Atreides... and again, he\'s actually closer to the age that the character is supposed to be at the beginning of the book, but he comes off as a little Emo.Again, trippy as it was, the 1984 version did this better. The Sci-Fi Channel did it better...\nNow, this film really LOOKS good. The visuals are immersive. But without strong characters and story to back them up, what\'s the point? It\'s almost like watching a Transformers movie. The thing is, they HAD strong characters and a story... they just didn\'t use them.', 'Although the film is called \'Dune\', the opening title refers to it as \'Dune Part One\'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being \'The One\', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from \'The Matrix\', also being \'The One\'.Regardless, \'Dune\' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won\'t satisfy everyone\'s palate, and if you\'re not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, \'Dune\' will not appeal to you. However, one can\'t help but be impressed by what they\'ve accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there\'s a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn\'t always understand the character motives, and I still don\'t really understand what Paul\'s real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father\'s footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don\'t follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like \'Tremors\', \'The Chronicles of Riddick\', and \'Star Wars\'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as "My Lord"? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I\'ve had my rant, \'Dune\' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.', 'Greetings from Lithuania."Dune. Part I" (2021) was amazing cinematic experience. This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven\'t read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won\'t lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of "Blade Runner 2049" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can\'t ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!', "I feel I should start by saying I have minimal context for this film. I've never read the book(s?) and I don't really remember the '84 movie all that well. So I'm going into this fairly fresh and with no real explanations. That said...With all due respect to the brilliant Mr. Villeneuve, this felt like a massive superficial film that is a technical marvel but feels so hollow. Seriously, this thing is GORGEOUS with a capital everything, the sound is spectacular, it's shot beautifully but there just doesn't feel like enough meat beneath all the flash. It is a masterpiece on paper, with performances to match the visuals but after two and a half hours I felt like I was struggling to stay awake through an overlong prologue to an actual story.Yeah, this is going to be multiple movies (assuming they get the green light for another) and it feels like it. Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story. Still think it's worth checking out, just for the technical mastery and stunning presentation but... That's about all that's here.", 'About an hour of back story that really made no sense. The Atreades are on their own planet, so they take about a thousand troops to the spice planet to mine for spice, at the request of the Emperor. When the colony is attacked, that is the end of the Atreades? What happened to their home planet?A lot of the back-story did not make sense. Even worse, the pace of this movie was incredibly slow and boring. The story of the Fremen is not explained. Why are the Harkkunen evil? That is not explained. The Harkkunen have been making gigantic amounts of money from their monopoly on the spice planet, so why are they bitter?I had a lot of questions. The dialogue was not very helpful. The Mother and Grandmother have special powers, why? Nothing is explained about their sect, or why French lead actor, Chalamet, might be "The One."There is not much action until the last 40 minutes or so. The fact that the family doctor can turn off the alarm system and shields to the entire colony was incredibly lame. That nobody was awake to know they were being attacked was even more lame. That King Atreades had absolutley no security staff, and got his ass kicked by the skinny doctor was pathetic.James Brolin is the top fighter for the Atreades clan, and he does almost nothing in this movie. Jason Momoa is the other top warrior and he is marginal. Both of these actors are wasted in this movie. They basically do nothing except to encourage the French kid with standard cliches.Zendaya shows up in the same visions that are repeated numerous times in the movie. There is a constant mix of the Chalamet kid\'s visions with the actual reality, and that is confusing.', "Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.", 'I have never read the books that Frank Herbert wrote. I have friends who were big on these books and told me about them and how the original movie adaptation was lacking much content. Apparently the books are laboriously detailed and complex.Immediately I noticed there is a lot more filler in this production. Is it needed? I guess it depends on the viewer. The first production by David Lynch was abridged and rejected by many, but I enjoyed it for the efforts and the constraints put on him by the executives. He had a limited budget and had to keep the run time down. This was pre-LotR trilogies and 3 hour movies were not acceptable.The second production I have watched is the SciFi mini series which was good but forgettable. It was too complex and detailed. That casting was more than acceptable and the effort in to special effects was visually entertaining.This production is amazingly wonderful visually. I wish I would have read the books so I have something to compare the scenes to, because it might give me a better perspective to what I\'m watching.Several of the scenes in the first 35 minutes are very similar to the 1984 version of Dune. The hand in the box/fear is the mind killer scene I think was very well done. The fight scene with Gurney is good, I liked the special effects but the scene felt cut short.When I saw the trailer I was put off by the casting choices, specifically Paul. However, here I am in 36 minutes and I\'ve been pleased with the most of the cast\'s performances. Again, I wish I had read the books so I would have a better understanding of the descriptions of the characters.Some of them are very similar to each production, but others are complete opposites! I do not care for Jason Momoa being cast. He seems out of place. I noticed the dramatic changes in male/female of some of the characters as well, the age and the height of them. I\'m not sure of the book and the description given. I did like that they used an Asian for Dr. Yueh.I\'ve never understood the plot where Dr. Yueh turns off the shields. This seems more like deus ex machina to me because the writer needed a betrayal. I don\'t care for how simple the process was for this character to commit the betrayal. It should have had more of a complexity to it. Then in the reverse, the whole "buy freedom for my wife" by putting a hollow tooth with poison in the Duke\'s mouth so he can blow the poison on to the Barron? That\'s about as complex and convoluted of a plot device as you can make, but they do one then the other back to back. It is a low point in the story.The one thing that immediately disappointed me is the audio. I normally listen to my movies on a 12/100 level while using headphones. Sometimes I have to raise the volume to 18 or 20, but this production I had to raise it to 58/100 just to hear some of the voices. The voices were not brought to the forefront. When a character whispers, you don\'t keep their voice at a whisper. You bright it forward in the audio track so it is raised above the music or the ambient sounds. I also do not like how the volume rises and drops when transitional music is played. The audio is definitely a problem, and this is a production issue. I blame the director and the audio technicians for this.There are several scenes which I feel aren\'t needed. When Paul is talking to the servant who is watering the palms. I didn\'t feel this was necessary. It is more filler than it is to story development.As I stated, there are many scenes which are not in either of the previous productions. I think many of them added to the story which I did not understand previously. Some of them are worthwhile, others are filler which the production could have left on the cutting room floor.Overall, I think it is a good script, produced in an attempt to be true to the book. There are highs and lows. Some scenes great, other scenes meh. I question some of the casting. I think they did as good as they could do given the two different productions before it, but failed to find a middle ground.', "Well, where to begin here? Long, very long movie of a very slow pace, with very dark and gloomy lights, very dour mood and very depressing feeling overall. It produces a rather sour taste and this sand sees to ooze everywhere. Timoth√©e Chalamet is OK, but he is not yet the star to save the whole production. Other more mature stars, like Rebecca Ferguson or Oscar Isaac seem to be slightly better off here but the whole plot does not allow the to be beyond very tight frames which stifle them a lot. Zendaya or Josh Brolin are so limited in their screen time that it is almost null and void. Maybe, Jason Momoa is the real winner here with his bright and powerful prsence.Generally, the aftertaste is dour and sour and leaves no desire to wait for the second part, as the unbearably slow tempo of the first part and dark brooding atmosphere produce very limited wish to persevere.I'd say I am not impressed. Surely, this one is better then the awful 1984 version but still leaves much too much to be desired. To tell the truth, this is not my Captain speaking.", "Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timoth√©e Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie. He puts his skills into the epic feel of this franchise. It feels right... coming from a non-book-reader.", "Snail's paced bore. I couldn't understand half of what was said (not that it mattered). I was hoping the big worms would take over since they were more interesting than the lousy actors.", 'More so than even \'Lord of the Rings\', Frank Herbert\'s \'Dune\' is an extremely difficult story to translate to film. All of the novel\'s many, many moving parts require the kind of explanation that just isn\'t possible in the format. Therefore you have to find a kind of cinematic shorthand the way David Lynch did with his polarizing 1984 adaptation. Or else you go w/a mini-series, which allows for a greater runtime ala the SyFy network\'s 2000 attempt. Here the solution was to cut the novel essentially in half. Unfortunately that creates an entirely different problem. Half a story simply isn\'t satisfying.The film itself is handsomely shot and the f/x are strong, though I dare say the design work is rather bland. The score by Hans Zimmer is an oppressive yet forgettable kit-bash of the "exotic" white noise that litters so many fantasy and sci-fi films in the 21st century. The characters are under-cooked, but the actors themselves are by and large solid.As someone who has read the novel three times I have a difficult time deciding if the uninitiated will have even an inkling of what\'s going on. But even if they do, I can\'t imagine that what we get here will ultimately be satisfying in a substantive way.', 'It physically pains me to leave a negative review for "Dune" and to give the film that I\'ve been eagerly waiting to see for 2 years such a low score. Note: this was my subjective experience and I\'m about to give my personal opinion on the film; I should mention that I am the only person I know who did not love it (although not many people have seen it yet). In any case, I suggest you still go see it in a theater by yourself and form your own opinion about it.A little intro for those of you who hear the word "Dune" in the context of a movie for the first time. "Dune" is a 60s science-fiction novel taking place in the time of advanced space travel. The family of young Paul (Timothy Chalamet) is burdened with protecting the planet Arrakis, a home to the most valuable resource in the galaxy: "spice". With it\'s hostile native people, giant sandworms and interstellar wars, "Dune" is described by some as "Star Wars for adults". This best-selling epic (which I haven\'t read) was not very successfully adapted to screen by David Lynch in 1984, but this 2021 film here was supposed to be The Adaptation that will please each and every fan and revive the epic story for the newer generations. The director Dennis Villeneuve has proven himself a master of filmmaking over the last 10 years (Blade Runner 2049; Arrival; Prisoners; Sicario). He seemed like the perfect man for the job, considering he did the impossible and made a sequel for a classic movie "Blade Runner" that turned out better than the original. As I saw it, "Dune" was supposed to be the biggest, the most exciting and the most expensive film of the year (just look at the cast), and the last time I\'ve been that excited to see a film was probably Infinity War 3 years ago. I went for the best possible cinematic experience - IMAX 3D; and bought the tickets for the first release date in my country. Three hours later, I walked out of the theater in a bad mood. As they say: "my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined". And, after pondering on it for two days, it isn\'t at all because I set my expectations too high.There is this little thing called "dramatic structure": how any dramatic work such as a book or a film are or should be built. There are obviously deviations and different versions of it (things like Memento and Pulp Fiction still exist), but probably the most commonsensical, useful and widely-used one is called the "Freytag\'s pyramid" and consists of five parts: exposition (introduction to the characters and setting), rising action, climax, falling action and resolution. They give you this structure in school as an essay-writing guide. "Dune" is a 2h 35min exposition. There is no plot. They forgot the story. The movie is finished before any kind of rising action begins. After waiting for two years and three hours, you get a National Geographic documentary "Life of Paul: Struggles on Arrakis". I admit that I had no idea Villeneuve had planned that Dune would be a two-part movie from the very beginning, but I also can\'t be blamed because it was not at all clear from it\'s marketing; judging by the fact that the whole audience looked around in confusion after the abrupt non-ending - I wasn\'t the only one. That really doesn\'t matter though, I did not come to the cinema to watch a three hour introduction to something that may never even be made - Villeneuve never got a contract for a sequel yet, it will only be made if this piece of work makes enough money. How can you make a film without a cohesive story that relies entirely on it\'s continuation without ever being absolutely sure that this continuation is in the making? Why would you ever face those odds and why not make at least something of importance happen in part one, so it can be viewed and enjoyed as a standalone picture?It doesn\'t stop there. Perhaps this is more of a criticism of the source material, but Dune is like a made-up history book with all-too real actors, politics and little details. It\'s like "The Martian" with it\'s extreme scientific accuracy, but here the author thinks up a world and maximizes realism, thinking through all the little details about how this world functions: trade, spice harvesting, religion, wars... Usually it\'s amazing that authors pay so much attention to details, but in this case it doesn\'t work. It feels like you\'re watching a drama-documentary about some ancient (despite it being set in the future) civilization with every meticulous little detail built in. Like, really? You had a whole universe of creativity at the palm of your hand, an ocean of unlimited potential, and you chose to simply dress "Earth geopolitics" in a science-fiction disguise? I felt like setting these artificial intellectual boundaries by tying the story tightly to real-life problems and patterns seriously hindered Dune\'s creative potential. My point is - I did not come to the movies to watch the news.The annoying thing is how contrarily perfect the cinematic and visual aspects of the film are - Greig Fraser\'s cinematography, strongly reminiscent of the work of Roger Deakins, does not get any better than this. The unimaginable scale of the film is truly Nolan big, and the IMAX sound makes you feel the sand brushing against your cheeks. You can almost feel a slight, subtle scent of peaches emanating from the main character. Also, despite the limited room to play around in, the acting is simply top notch, an admirable ensemble with every single actor in their perfect place. However, when it comes to the soundtrack by my beloved Hans Zimmer, it felt pretty plain - cool at times, but very far from remarkable in comparison to anything of his previous works, from Interstellar, Inception and Gladiator to Lion King. But all these positive elements could not have ever made up for the biggest failure of them all - the simple lack of story. I watched the movie with my girlfriend and my cousin. They both loved it and I asked them to explain to me in 2-3 sentences what the movie was about. They couldn\'t. And neither could I, because it isn\'t about anything. It\'s a three hour introduction to a film that may never come to exist.Honestly, the trailer was more exciting than the film itself.', "Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timoth√©e Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve. This is just Part One, i eagerly await the second half. Directed/Co-Written by Denis Villeneuve. 9/10.", "Forgoing a lengthy analysis here's a list of things I disliked. Some spoilers.1. Every character, especially the leaders lacked charisma or gravitas. No discernible chemistry. I did not respect or care about any of them especially Paul. There was no emotion between Paul and his parents. They didn't even seem to care about each other but each parent was using Paul for their own purposes. Why should I care if house Atreides falls?2. Josh Brolin and his men constantly threatening the people who got close to the duke even though those people were guests asked there to help the duke... laughable.The duke yelling at his son about taking risks right after he risked everyone to rescue the spice workers..laughable.3 poorly delivered or non existent exposition. Mostly due to flatly delivered dialogue. Add to that weirdly edited dialogue sequences with people looking at each other randomly.4 the dream sequences were annoying... random shots of mostly nothing important. The only thing important about the dreams is to establish he is glimpsing the future and evolving into something else... just establish it and be done with it... stop interrupting the story with it.5 the entire movie had the most depressing color pallet..even before they got to dune. It was joyless.6 multiple instances of plot points not being foreshadowed or being discarded...for example knowing Paul's mother knows how to fight hand to hand would have added tension when they met the freemen. The scene where the emperors soldiers float down to attack in the desert..The freemen rise up out of the sand to battle then... next thing you see is the soldiers coming to attack Paul...what happened to the brave freemen trying to protect them? I guess I assume they all died. Another example... you never get a sense of how valued Dr Huey is so his betrayal falls flat. They are essentially betrayed by an insignificant character. You don't even find out why until the betrayal occurs... no tension. I could go on and on about flat or failed plot points in this movie.I liked the worms and the sense of scale about how large they were you get sucked into the sand as they approach.I like Skarsgard as the Baron... all combined 2 minutes of him. Even though he was channeling Brando in Apocalypse Now... it worked.", "I fell asleep the 1st and 2nd time. Got 1 hour in and gave up on it bored. This movie is such a drag. There is not a single captivating thing about the movie. Not the plot, not the story, not the action, not the Suspense. So slow didn't even care towards the second half. What a huge disappointment after so much hype around it. Waste of time. The over dramatic seriousness of the characters made it even worst. The movie was boring, dragging and had too many unnecessary scenes that didn't contribute to overall plot of the story, they should've just made it a TV Series instead. Nowhere near as gritty or screwed up as 1984 original cat milk. Fun fact there are 3 versions of Momoa in movie. Long beard, short beard and no-beard. The movie More like long close-up shots of people's face while they're thinking, everybody talking Shakespearean, overemotional & overlong scenes of people doing NOTHING. It's an incredibly slow burning movie with little action, and the action they have is quite frankly boring. I get this is only part one but it didn't offer nothing in my opinion.", "I was hoping Dune 2021 would more rigorously stick to the Book's plot and bring alive Herbert's detailed story in a way the compressed / compromised Dune 1984 could not. Instead D2021 glosses over or completely leaves out major plot points, changes key aspects of its characters, makes up new plots when convenient, or simply repeats certain scenes from D1984 with nearly the same dialog but without the necessary context. D1984 also has significantly better acting. Zendaya's acting is so flat the EKG wouldn't register. Timothee Chalamet's acting is similarly flat and uninspiring: For his Paul Atriedes, Spice is salt and very mild pepper. D2021's truly beautiful CGI can't compensate for the fact that no one watching the film cares one iota for the fate of any of its characters. Sad.", "I wonder what percentage of people who watch this latest adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune have actually read the book; I haven't. I found the film about as dry as the desert world on which it takes place. It looks a million dollars (it should... it cost $165million to make), with impressive production design, wonderful costumes, and top-notch special effects, but the storytelling is dull. Does serious sci-fi have to be so po-faced?Timoth√©eeee Chaletmaid plays 7-stone weakling Paul Atreides who gets sand kicked in his face by the Harkonnen, who launch a devastating attack after his family receive governership of the planet Arrakis, where the valuable commodity known as 'spice' is harvested. Surviving the assault, Paul and his mother avoid being killed by Harkonnen soldiers and eaten by giant sand-worms, and ultimately join forces with the indigenous people, the Fremen.Not being familiar with the source material, a lot of the finer plot details went way over my head, making the whole experience even more of a chore. And this film is only half of the story: director Denis Villeneuve has split the book into two halves, and is currently working on part two now that enough profit has been made from part one. I can't say that I'm particularly excited by the prospect of spending another two and a half hours on Arrakis.4/10 for the visuals, but not exactly riveting viewing.", "Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timoth√©e Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see. This is an all-time great science fiction movie that is an easy 10/10.", 'Frank Herbert was a guy who stumbled upon a brilliant idea, completely failed to bring it to life on the page with his total lack of writing ability, and yet was rewarded for his efforts anyway when his book became a resounding success.I can\'t imagine how hard it must have been for him to write it. He could barely string a sentence together, and utterly failed to make multiple sentences flow. It must have been painstaking for him to write, and it was certainly painstaking to read.And yet it became a bestseller, and did for sci-fi what Lord of the Rings did for fantasy. People really don\'t ask for much when it comes to talent in writers, do they? Tolkien is another example. And Thomas Harris. Perhaps people read so rarely that they don\'t expect to find the writing engaging, and so don\'t notice when it isn\'t."Dune: Part One", the movie, is about as dull and lifeless in style as the book was in execution. There is even so little colour to its images that you may as well be watching a black and white movie. It doesn\'t even have an arresting look, for all the money that obviously went into it. And the actors are boring: what does Timothee Chalamet do, but look wan, pale and wide-eyed? And Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista? Jessica was really the protagonist of the novel, a strong, female character before that became a tired clich√©. And Baron Harkonnen was a pretty cool villain. Here the actress who plays Jessica is boring, and the always dependable Stellan Skarsgard is barely on-screen as the Baron.I often considered turning off "Dune: Part One". It was so boring and was never able to grab my attention. I stuck with it for some reason. Maybe because, for all its faults, at least it kept up a pretty good pace, never spending too much time with its wafer-thin characters. So I made it to the end. I shouldn\'t have bothered.', "A movie made for the big screen. The sound design is great and Hans Zimmer is awesome as always. The visuals are pretty good too, considering everything plays out on a rather mundane sand planet. The visual effects are perfect.Dune is like Villeneuve's other movies rather slow and I almost fell asleep a few times, but other than that it was an awesome experience.The casting was great and the acting was on point. The story was very interesting and made me want to see more.", 'I simply cannot stand the dead-eyed leads.Looking "wistfully" does not denote acting ability.It\'s like Hollywood had a board with every "big name" younger star on it and they just literally threw darts at it for the casting in this film.Just because you know their names, doesn\'t mean they\'ll actually have onscreen chemistry or fit for the roles.', "Aquaman and Drax together for the worst time. Slow-moving. Great special effects. Great cinematography. Bad direction. Bad casting. And you know there are problems when you need two rewrites of the screenplay (one of the writers was responsible for Prometheus, who almost single-handedly ruined the Alien franchise) This is what comes from nepotism in the film industry. Lawrence of Arabia this isn't. The dialogue is stilted. Some of the acting is outrageously bad. I'm sure there are those who will think this is an outstanding classic in the making, but as far as I'm concerned, it's as torturous as watching paint dry.", "This was a hopefully awaited new dimension of an intelligent blockbuster movie and a solid proof that arthouse and entertainment don't need to be contradictory. Villeneuve's vision is strong, emotionally deep, visually stunning and powerful, his seriousness and pathos is mind provoking and innovative. Chalamet's coming of age is touching, he portraits his character with beauty, innocence and sensitivity. I'd love to see how the story and the characters will be developed in a possible second part.", "Perhaps the greatest lesson that can be drawn from Denis Villeneuve's Dune is that ultimately an entirely satisfying adaptation of the novel is impossible. Nonetheless, Villeneuve's version is the closest at succeeding so far, and is one of the more enjoyable theatrical experiences of 2021.Villeneuve stays very adherent to the original work, even in the smaller elements. There are a few omissions however, and the first scenes are not present in the novel.His version has however not rendered from the sense of mistery that permeates the beginning of the novel. It immediately submerges its reader in the world of Dune, without any introduction, and the complex situation is slowly unraveled throughout the narrative. Villeneuve's previous films prove that this approach could have been undertaken by him, but the 2021 film chose instead to rely on several expository scenes that explain too much to the audience. Some of the revelations that are hinted at very early were not as clear until the second half of the novel (yet to be adapted). A choice dictated by the destination to a wider target audience, for sure, but that ultimately adds dryness to the film.Another slight disappointment might come from the score by Hans Zimmer. It does render the majestic epic scale of the film, but it perhaps remains overly somber and ambiental in scenes where it could have charged up the depicted tense situation.What works best in Dune is the flawless casting. Whoever has read the novel could hardly imagine different actors to portray the characters. Dune also succeeds in rendering the alien scape of the desertic planet Arrakis, as well as the other planets that are even only hinted in the novel, without reduntantly using the strong saturated colours of Lynch's version. Greig Fraser's cinematography is truly a feast for the eyes, aided by a desaturated yet captivating coloring. Rest assured: the sky is never blue, which is something that the latest promotional poster seemed to suggest. On the other hand, what the film does borrow from the never made Jodorowsky version is some of the production design elements, especially for the Harkonnens.Ultimately, even if Villeneuve did not make the perfect Dune film (and it is fairly possible to say at this point that such a film cannot exist), it is an entertaining film. It is entertaining and\nkeeps the viewer glued to the screen even despite its slow nature, leaves the viewer wanting for more, and that alone makes up for all the small imperfections it features.(Extracts from my longer review on my blog, comeandreview)", "Denis Villeneuve is not a bad director; but has a really pacing issue. Most of his movies like The Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 over welcome their stay. Both of them could have been far better with some minutes less and more focus on the main story.DUNE makes exactly the same mistake; most of the movie is in David Lean mode (Lawrence of Arabia) with too long takes on the desert, on the rocks or deep dramatic and profound looks of the main characters. Adding to the agony; the very confusing dreams or visions; and about a 1000 takes of Zedaya digitally enhanced blue eyes; there is very little time left in the two and half hours to complete properly the story. Solution; trust people to see the older movies, the tv series or read the book and take out essential parts. The Baron other nephew (Feyd), the Emperor and his daughter or transport union creatures are nowhere to be seen.The conflict of interest is barely explained in a few lines of dialog; the Duke achievements with the Fremen are not given any importance.A friend of mine, not familiar with the above, ask me what was happening and who were some of the characters; so do not expect to understand most of it if you are not familiar.In the acting department; Chamalet is fine but he does not look as a rebel fighter; more as a scared young boy some mother issues. Fergusson however is very good she even survives her many many face close-ups.For those who complained about Lynch's 1984; in this one story is the basically same but with slower pace. Lynch made a more compelling first part in 60 minutes with far easy to understand and with more character development than the 150 minutes in the new version. The only noticeable difference; the insinuation of some complot from the Bene Gesserit with Jessica involvement.Last but not least; while the visuals are too spectacular; action scenes are not and with little or not emotion.In brief; better visuals but not much more than the old movie and the series.", "I don't get how most praise comes from settings and effects, it's 2021, most things look great, it's a nice world but that's not enough to be a great film.I get there's more than one planned but it kills the pace, it's so slow, so little happens scene fo scene, there's strange logic around space travel and on ground sword fighting, seems a mish mash to suit what they wanted to do aesthetically.The acting is wooden, cold and very little chemistry, dialogue is stale and done and let's be real could put 25 films up there swap the actors, costumes and set and it's the same theme, same tired story. Just boring.First film I've ever walked out of, I'm not interested in if the last 30 mins was perfection which I doubt, a film is an experience and that 2 hours was beyond boring.I find this kinda film the hardest genre to get into unless your that way inclined, most others there's normally something that hooks you, this just doesn't.I do not get how people think, it's almost like they're bored and confused so think it's automatically good.

I would be shocked if they kept making more of these movies! Oh yeah and the girl that plays Mary Jane in Spider-Man, I think might say a few words in this movie at the very end that's it!

Unfortunately Dune fails at being excellent in many categories...The bad: the leading actor has little to no charisma. Just my personal taste. But besides him, even the other (good) actors look out of place and even look a bit silly (Josh Brolin). That\'s really annoying, that the acting isnt up to par for what should have been an exciting dramatic scifi epic.More bad: the entire look and feel of this movie is rather mediocre and kinda cheap. The visual effects (from the very start) are NOT impressive at all. They look really cheap. Nothing like the terrific special effects in Bladerunner 2049.Even the music, the editing, the photography, all those technical details which can lift a movie up to the stratosphere, are all quite mediocre. What a disappointment.Even more bad: I hate it when there are voice overs that constantly start explaining to me what is happening in the story. Too many characters and periods in the story have to be contineously explained to me as a viewer by this irritating voice over. I dont mind if I dont understand everything I see, I dont need a voice over nanny...Not any good? With so much money, time and potential available to make this movie, I felt really disappointed, that this isnt even near anything like other classic scifi movies.Not terribly bad, simply mediocre.

And if Frank Herbert taught us anything, it was to have an open mind.Villeneuve has shown us, with Dune, that dreams can be given justice, if the heart is in the right place.A grand achievement of cinema and of science fiction. Many will wish that Herbert was still around to have seen this. But of course he already has.Salut.", 'Two confessions: (1) I thought the 1984 version was wonderful. (2) I watched it on a 65" TV. My assumption about TV was I would screen it on TV and if I loved it as much as the original, I would go to the movies and spend the $. About 10 minutes in I was really bored. Acting is terrible. Not just poor, but terrible. Everyone was terrible. The "special effects" are certainly unimpressive. Especially considering it\'s 2021 not 1984. Then there\'s the music, which is so poor you probably never thought about it. And worse than anything else, the direction and the photography are film school level. There is nothing in this film that appealed to me. I stopped watching after 30 minutes.', 'I, first of all, applaud Legendary for allowing the director to do his thing on a budget of 165 million. No fan of the book can be disappointed by the end result but I don¬¥t know if the general audience will see eye to eye as Villeneuve stuck too close to details that matter to him while leaving his audience and even the overall book behind. Dune 2021 is the best adaptation yet but too much of the plot and players were skipped to focus on Paul & Jessica who are the real film. The end result is an accurate depiction of their journey in the world of Herbert but it\'s debatable if his world & story are fully on-screen. Only Atreides characters are allowed any significant screen time and even their hereditary enemies the Harkonnen are reduced to bit parts. The grandiose and lived-in world is a sight to behold but we see so little of it and are explained even less so viewers might be confused why the film¬¥s technology is so functional and basic. A was especially perplexed by how bare-bones the explanation of the spice is. It is the whole reason for the plot! No guild navigators or space-folding are seen on screen for example. The effects, costumes, score and performances leave little to be desired. The dialogue is easy to follow even if the context is often missing but some iconic book quotes are left behind. It is possible to view this film as your basic hero\'s journey narrative if one wants to. The way Herbert inverts and criticizes such tales is also all on-screen even if the fruits of these details will only ripen in the second half and hopefully movie 3. Aka Dune Messiah. Our director stated it as his current end goal.I don¬¥t want to sound too negative and I had a great time with the film and look forward to revisiting it. I simply fear that the lack of mass appeal or rewatchability for casual audiences will leave the story forever unfinished. The film adapts 60% of the story, minus missing political elements & characters that a sequel would need to cover immediately before moving forward with the story. Let\'s just say that the film goes out of its way to not follow the Chekhov\'s gun principle. Watch and champion this movie if you are a fan of heady sci-fi and of course the Herbert novel(s) but push the source material, its full-cast audiobook, or its new 3 part Graphic Novel adaptation on the people you recommend the film to as they will need a safety net to appreciate the film and to be hungry for more. Let\'s hope against hope that someone will dare to adapt Dune 4 one of these days. Maybe the next reboot? 8,5/10PS: The 3-hour long "Dune (1984) Alternative Edition Redux" (7.5/10) is a solid companion to this film and features backstory and characters that have so far been skipped. Make it your next sci-fi viewing experience.', "Dune is a very well done movie with a great cast, music, visual effects, scenery and the direction of the camera. It's an amazing feeling to see a movie that is payin an homage to the book.Frank Herbert made a great book about society and an messiah that is getting the feeling of a savior of the people. Denis Villeneuve took that book and made the best movie of the year with Timoth√©e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolinand many others.Timoth√©e Chalamet shines in this role as Paul Atreides. He takes it all like he is the character and makes an amazing performance. Also he has the same qualities as Daniel Day Lewis and maybe he will be the next Lewis (John Campea said it first). Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem doesn't do much in the movie but while their on screen, they don't act the are the characters as does everybody else, but I just had to mention this two actors.The music is by Hans Zimmer and although it's all about the sounds and not the music that works for me. When Paul and his mother are fleeing for the second time that music was breathtaking. Zimmer has completely changed the way I listen to music, 'cause even I now will listen to just sounds and get emotional over it.The camera is so on point with all of the scenes. It has a way of showing you every little thing with out the audience yawning. I felt that the camera and music were really beautifully placed together and I had an emotional feeling to them at the same time.The plot is is really good but we have seen it already by David Lynch, this time we were waiting to see something different from the director of Arrival, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve. He is the master at tge taking time and gets you to feel the movie.", 'Dune 2021\'s cinematography is largely composed of muted browns and grays, desolate landscapes and buildings, almost all night-time scenes, a really depressing environment and VERY hard to watch, making it VERY difficult to stay awake. A good argument could\'ve been made to do this in black-and-white. The pacing is glacial, you can feel your arteries harden, your hair start to gray. It\'s all dialogue of political and military strategy - can you conceive of topics more boring?! Huge monolithic sandworms that swallow mining machinery - that\'s gotta be good for their digestion! Action? Zippo, zilch until 75 freakin\' minutes in! All the character surnames are distinctly non-English, more middle-eastern/asian, but then you have Jason Momoa\'s character named "Duncan Idaho" like some misplaced cowboy. There is modern, even post-modern high-tech weaponry on display, yet ground battles are done with Iron Age swords, what?! Properly edited, this could\'ve run for 60 mins instead of the interminable 150 mins. We\'ve had to wait almost 40 years (!) for a Dune re-make and this is a VERY VERY disappointing result, and it\'s only part one of two or three?! And no others have even been greenlit yet, so if it even happens, part two will be like 3 yrs out!', '5/10 - impressive visuals/technical aspects and a pretty stacked cast can only do so much to lift up a relatively boring story that drags on for much of the runtime.', "Dune is a spectacular movie, but I can't give it 10 having read the book.The visuals are a gold standard. Villanueve is evolving as an artist, and if you imagine what the person who made Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 can do with a bigger budget and a bigger universe, you get Dune. Every single element of the Dune universe is faithful to the book and is beautifully realistic.The cast is great, with Chalamet and Bautista being standouts. Glossu Rabban is given a bigger role than in the book, even though it's still minor, and Bautista does not disappoint.The story: the universe of Dune is complex and the narrative is full of intersecting plot lines. Instead of blindly following the book, the adaptation is more focused and the expositions are not on the nose.However, maybe it's inevitable with a big screen adaptation, but some important plot points were lost. For example, the revelation of Paul about their connection to the Harkonnens, or the more detailed explanation about the imperial politics and the great houses. The importance of the spice production and what it does is not highlighted. Instead of the tangled web and complex origin story, it's basically foreign invaders oppressing indigenous people to extract resources. We are shown the mentats, briefly, but they are basically advisers... and that's it. Where is the mention of the ban on the thinking machines?The House of Corrino, the Spacing Guild, Feyd-Rautha are not shown. Hope they will be featured in Part 2.I suppose that's one of Villanueve's strong points, the ability to focus. But I remember the book well, so it feels like parts are missing.", 'Watching director Denis Villeneuve\'s groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert\'s classic science fiction novel "Dune" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. Unlike its ill-fated predecessor, David Lynch\'s critically reviled "Dune" (1984), which shoehorned Herbert\'s gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, Villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. Instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. Some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but Warner Brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before "Dune" generated some box office traction. Mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. Meantime, Villeneuve retreads several Lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. You cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and Byzantine political intrigue. Although classified as science fiction, "Dune" never degenerates into a juvenile "Buck Rogers" space opera. "Star Wars: Rogue One" lenser Greg Fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. Surrounding Timoth√©e Chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgard. Overall, "Dune" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. Nevertheless, the filmmakers don\'t bewilder the audience with narrative overload. Clearly, Villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing "Blade Runner 2049" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.Imagine a mash-up of "Star Wars" and "Game of Thrones," and you\'ll have a clue about what ensues. Specifically, "Dune" takes place in the year 10,191. This tour de force saga of clashing empires unfolds on the bleak desert planet of Arrakis. This savage, sun-scorched world is the only source in the universe for a unique mineral called spice. Not only does interstellar space travel hinge on spice, but it also is a psychedelic drug that heightens awareness and lengthens life. The evil Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsg√•rd of "Good Will Hunting") of the House of Harkonnen, who amounts to a smaller version of Jabba the Hutt, has reaped an obscene fortune in spice from Arrakis over the last 80 years. Now, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV removes the Baron and replaces him with a rival, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac of "Ex-Machina") of the mighty House of Atreides, who hails from the ocean planet of Caladan. Accompanied by his consort Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson of "Doctor Sleep") and their teenage son, Paul (Timoth√©e Chalamet of "Lady Bird"), the Duke arrives on Arrakis with his aide, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin of "Sicario"), and a vast army. Leto suspects the corrupt Emperor may be setting him up for failure.Pandemonium erupts soon after Leto has taken over the spice mining operation. Earlier, the Duke had vowed to forge an alliance with the natives. Known as the Fremen, this disgruntled nomadic race resides in Arrakis\'s deep caverns and conducts campaigns like guerrilla warriors against the spice miners. Suffering dreadfully under the Baron, the Fremen expect similar treatment from Leto. The Duke dispatches a scout, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa of "Aquaman"), to embed himself among them and win their hearts and minds. Swathed in hooded white cloaks, this mahogany-skinned tribe has dazzling cobalt blue eyes from using spice. A blue-eyed babe haunts Paul\'s dreams. Meantime, the mining equipment Leto inherited from the Baron is in rough shape. If the broiling temps on the surface weren\'t bad enough, prodigious sandworms--some as long as 13-hundred feet--cruise beneath the shifting sands like great white sharks. These leviathans can wrap their elastic mouths, bristling with zillions of wicked, razor-sharp fangs, around an entire spice harvesting machine. Eventually, treachery within Leto\'s palace topples his rule, and the Baron\'s soldiers annihilate Atreides\' army. Miraculously managing to escape, young Paul takes refuge with the Fremen and ponders a rebellion against the Baron.Comparisons between "Dune" and "Star Wars" are inevitable. Indeed, both films share certain formulaic scenes which seem virtually interchangeable. An empire-building yarn with anti-colonial sentiments, "Dune" takes itself far more seriously than "Star Wars." When Paul watches his mentor perish, our hero suffers as tragically as Luke when he witnessed the demise of Obi-wan Kenobi. "Dune" differs, too, because it is a sword and sandal saga about supernatural critters. Arrakis makes Tatooine seem like a beach resort. Villeneuve and "Prometheus" writer Jon Spaihts and "A Star Is Born" scripter Eric Roth don\'t overwhelm the audience with volumes of exposition that cluttered up the Lynch film. Instead, they parcel out exposition and use it to foreshadow events. The warfare is conducted with ancient as well as futuristic weapons, with emphasis on ancient weapons. The dragonfly helicopters-known as ornithopters-look exciting. The crisp dialogue is both pointed and compelling. Villeneuve and company never cut our underdog heroes any slack in this initial bloodthirsty chapter, and the evil Baron maintains the upper hand despite minor setbacks like a near-death experience. As villains go, the grotesquely fat Baron makes an admirable but unscrupulous adversary. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa wield their weapons like old hands. Unlike Lynch, Villeneuve doesn\'t rub our noses in unsavory violence. Nonetheless, the battles are savage without being sadistic. Hans Zimmer\'s brawling orchestral score with native choral interludes enhances the atmosphere. Altogether, "Dune" qualifies as the first truly great science fiction classic of the 21st century with a coming-of-age hero driven by prophetic dreams he cannot fathom.', "That Denis Villeneuve has mastered the sci-fi-genre like no other has been known at least since Arrival. Accordingly, my expectations were high for his heart project Dune, originally a famous book that Villeneuve has loved since childhood and which, after years of delay, has now made its way to the big screen. Villeneuve is a great champion of cinema in danger of extinction - and what he already brought with Blade Runner 2049, he delivers this time on an even more extreme scale: a MOVIE FOR CINEMA.Since I see Dune as a potential saviour of cinema, it is more important this time to write about the film per se and not its actors and characters. These should be familiar to most beforehand anyway - both as book connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs. Because even though Villeneuve again relies on his tried-and-tested visual exposition, some prior knowledge of the family homes, rivalries and distribution of roles is certainly not a disadvantage. Therefore, rule number 1: roughly memorise the premise in order to be able to follow the plot comprehensively. As for the actors, it remains to be said that they all put on their absolute A-game. Timothee Chalamet shows that he can dominate blockbusters at a young age, although he is not the best despite a bravura performance. Namely, that's Rebecca Ferguson in the role of his mother, who pretty much downplays all emotional facets. All except joy, because no one really feels that in Dune. Now and then there are pseudo-funny one liners, but they are always overshadowed by the fundamentally dystopian and catastrophic atmosphere. This is just as well, because Villeneuve is not exactly known for making humorous and positive films. So, rule number 2: don't expect any fast-moving fireworks of words. What Dune definitely is is an audiovisual masterpiece display that you only get to see in this form every few years. Watching this film at home would almost be a betrayal. Such a feat does not deserve this act of cosiness; here the cinematic experience has monopoly. From the very first second, we are accompanied by elongated shots of the sky, high-tech headquarters and desert dunes. These left such an impression on me that after the credits I was at a loss for words and my legs were shaking. Rule number 3: Go into the film as relaxed as possible, because you won't get that feeling again so quickly afterwards.This guide on how to approach Dune properly is necessary to fully engage with the film. Otherwise, it could be complicated to get excited about it. Sure, the images should impress everyone, because this is where Dune is truly unique. The narrative style, however, is something that personally keeps me from giving Villeneuve's childhood dream the highest possible rating. In fact, I expected the film to be even more sedate and wordless, so in that respect I was pleasantly surprised after quite a few dialogues in the first half. Of course, Dune is not a film that needs many words, since its visuality speaks for itself anyway. Towards the end, however, I occasionally had the feeling that it didn't quite know when it wanted to end. Lethargic scenes suggesting that the film was now over were still followed by surprising twists. But that is a minimal criticism of what is, in my opinion, the ultimate revelation for cinema and metaphorical narrative structure.", "To film fans - A very beautiful and well written film, unfortunately falls a little towards the end after a strong start, and robust progression.However this is a 2 part film so proceed to the movie with that mindset, because there is going to be a lot more in the 2nd featurette.Perfect casting, perfect performance. There was a difficulty in understanding the words from some of the characters.Unsure if this was a creative decision or editing error, but the movie looked too dim at some parts and could use a bit more brightness I feel, to capture facial expressions and setting better, nevertheless the cinematography is one of the most beautiful I have seen, this truly is picturesque beautiful like the milky way at night.To Dune fans - Frank Herbert would be so happy, the film captures the novel's spirit, and you will truly feel Paul's wit, anger, sadness and journey to Muad'Dib, thanks to Timothee Chalamet and the production.Expect few minor changes; Sardaukars are more dangerous, Baron doesn't look as disgusting, Fremens are much accurate and cooler, memorable lines from the novel are not in the film, dialogues spoken from different characters than the original from the novel.We all know how difficult it is to adapt Dune, if people though Lord of the Rings was hard, they clearly never read Dune. Do not expect perfection because the lore is so deep, it would require multiple prequels, or a prelude to Dune prologue explaining the vast universe of it. All and all, you are going to love it.Looking forward to the 2nd part, and hopefully the rest of Frank Herbert's Dune in movies.", 'I\'m not going to take the position of a "Dune Fanboy" who believes a Dune movie can do no wrong. This version suffers from a poor choice of actors. Leto does not have the screen presence of a Duke, Paul does indeed look like a boy and I\'m sorry... that\'s just not Lady Jessica. Duncan Idaho was better portrayed than any other character and really, seemed the only heart and soul in the entire film.Deviation from the original book is okay; I expect such in a movie. But this deviated needlessly, in ways that had me yawning. Presentation was poor. In a major battle scene the suits worn by the Fremen and Sardukar were so similar it was difficult to tell one from the other. The sandworms are not nearly as impressive as prior movies. Many vital dramatic points of the book (and prior movies) were left out, which cost a great deal of essential character.I was disappointed to find out it was Part 1 of (what 2, 3, 4?). There was nothing in the trailers that indicated this would be a multi-year series. Gah. This wasn\'t a "slow burner"; it was a fizzle. In this day of superb CGI in even the most basic films I wasn\'t impressed by the "special effects". There was far too much time spent on trivial drama without nearly enough focus on key plot elements.What was most missing in this version is the heart that made Dune such a masterpiece. The plot moves more slowly than the Baron, and in the end it was simply disappointing. I expected far more from a movie made in this decade than those made 21 and 37 years ago. Another reviewer mentioned this was very much like the TV miniseries created in 2000. I have to agree.I don\'t demand constant action/adventure in films, especially in a cerebral classic such as Dune. But I did expect some directing skill in both screen adaptation and directing. We\'re disappointed to find neither in this rendition. It\'s a shame to wait so long for a film, only to find the anticipated blockbuster is yet another mediocre attempt at bringing the impressive world of Dune to the main screen... and not all that different from what has gone before. I think that\'s what surprises me most is that it isn\'t significantly better than it is. They should have titled this "Dune Retro".', 'From the director of "Arrival" and "Blade Runner 2049", comes another sci-fi epic "DUNE: Part One" based on the novel.It\'s the year of 10191. There are different planets with different species of human. Our main character Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet) is the future of House Atreides. He is on an adventure to Arrakis, a beautiful planet that produces spies and full of dangerous sandworms.This is all I can say without spoilers. The thing about DUNE is it\'s stunning direction and breathtaking cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual image. Not to mention the amusing score (by Hans Zimmer).I watched DUNE in IMAX. Frequent shots of enormous spaceships and battle sequences are always a pleasure throughout. The making of this movie should be rightfully appreciated.It\'s a movie forcing the audience to pay attention, in a good way. The plot takes time to digest but once you know what\'s going on, it\'s a lot of fun.A lot of characters are introduced. Gurney (Josh Brolin), Glossu (Dave Bautista), Duncan (Jason Momoa) and I could go on. During it\'s 155 minute runtime however, not everyone gets enough characterization. I\'d like to see certain characters explored more. Maybe in the sequel.After all DUNE is still a beautiful sci-fi movie. It may not be everyone\'s cup of tea, but it\'s still a great piece of modern filmmaking.', "What can I say. Not only did I watch this movie, but my body was astrally projected to Arrakis.I got goosebumps whenever Hans Zimmer's melody pulsed through every sequence in this movie. I was surprised by the scale of the film's production. I went into trance together with Paul Atreides when he discovered that the tragic fate he envisioned was coming true.This movie only partially loses because it's half of a whole. I want to see more but I can't.Boring! For those with terrible taste, I have no doubts about that.As for the criticism of the white savior, read the damn books. Or just pay attention to what you're watching.Midway through the film, Paul has a vision of the future, in which the dangers of charismatic leadership elevated to godhood are thrown in the viewer's face. You have to be really mindless not to notice.This is one of the most epic sci-fi movies of all time. Watch it on the biggest screen you can.", "I read a number of books of the Dune series when I was a kid. I somehow forgot, but when I saw this movie I recalled so much. Like the aircraft that fly like dragon flies. Just amazing how this movie captures the atmosphere of the book series. As with Blade Runner the scenes take their time to sink in, it's visually stunning. The movie is long and there was no pause, but I was amazed how quickly time passed. I was captured and now I must wait long months for episode 2.", 'Just by the end of this almost 3 hours movie. I said to myself, this is where it finally gets interesting.Oops it is going to finish now.Denis Villeneuve has made an almost 6 hour long film and this is just the first part. It is a slog.One that looks great and it has wonderful special effects.Only the story moves at a crawl unlike the sandworms.David Lynch managed to make Dune in just over two hours, it was both weird and wonderful.The control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of a valuable spice that folds space has been transferred to the House Atreides. It could make them immensely rich.The House Harkonnen who previously operated the planet are livid.For Duke Leto Atreides this is a challenge that he cannot refuse. However it is a complex trap set by Emperor Shaddam who fears the House Atreides.Paul Atreides the precious son of the Duke has intense visions. Maybe he is the one who can unite with the Fremen, the natives of the planet Arrakis.Director Denis Villeneuve has made a wonderful looking movie. It is not enough if the pacing is off. The acting is somewhat stilted.Also why did he allow a shaven headed Stellan Skarsg√•rd to mimic Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now!', 'Dullsville. Rambling meandering walk through bland desert. How in the hell do you make this so dull? Perhaps to stretch out to unnecessary sequels or "books of"\nDenis Villeneuve still hasn\'t graduated film school.Pretentious, self-serving snore.Here\'s an idea, instead of dead soul dialogue vomiting try...a story of some kind.', 'I have neither read the book (yet) nor seen the old movie, but this one was really, really good. It felt like a realistic, dark and yet beautiful story-world, emotionally intelligent, suspenseful and visually stunning. I did read other reviews before watching this and saw several that called this film "emotionally hollow". Honestly, what movie did they watch??! Or is the problem rather that those viewers themselves were emotionally hollow? I think it was emotionally rich. Just Beautiful. Makes me want to read the book next. Go watch it.EDIT: I have read the book now - it does it justice in all the right places and the few changes were wise choices (eg. The multiple visions of Chani and making Kynes a black woman - the book IS old after all and women or people of colour need more representation). So - well done! Very well done!', 'Having seen the first Dune and enjoying the movie but the special effects were subpar. This fresh remake of Dune is a fantastic movie with a great storyline and superb special effects. The modern actors that portray the original characters not only follow the storyline but add a fresh and unique perspective to the movie. If you enjoyed the first Dune, you will like this one even better.** A MUST SEE**', 'From its most complex layers, to the simplest ones... From the most joyful or deeply human moments, to the most horrible or deeply inhuman moments. Sometimes raw and dark as life can be, sometimes wonderful and magical as life can be...A universal saga in infinitely more ways than one... A mythology filled with values and philosophies colliding with one another... A multiplicity of beliefs, where certainties and uncertainties are entwined with one another, like two inseparable snakes seeking each other without ever finding each other...Mystical and evanescent, as well as concrete and visceral... Dreams and premonitions, choices and actions, space and time... Or where the role that you play is written but is not, has already taken place but never will...A cinematographic fresco that is immensely majestic and glorious like the greatest of paintings or the greatest of concertos......

Everything in this movie is pure mastery, pure genius.An absolute masterpiece.', 'This is the story of a civilization far in the future. The emperor has a son who seems to dream. An alien civilization attacks earth and the story begins. The story is well-written. This movie is well-directed. Special effects are incredible and believable. You can see new types of helicopters, etc. I liked the background music and sound effects. The acting crew was awesome. Especially, Oscar Isaac and Timothee Chalamet were amazing in this movie. I recommend this movie to adventure and SCI-FI fans.', "I would give it just 9.5, because I think the importance of water came up short. And I also missed the banquet scene, what could have been a really clever scene with good dialogues.But the film is absolutly great, the actors are without exception awesome, the scenes/ the dialogues are perfect, the length of the film is perfect, it's close to the books (great story) and the visual effects are insane (beautiful scenes -> action/fight scenes/nature/spaceships/worms/citys). You can see how much love Villeneuve and the actors put in and I really want to see more. This is the beginning of a new universe. The time I have to wait for part 2 will be hard.In my opinion Villeneuve and Nolan are the best regisseurs in the world and they both made their visual/ their (characteristic for them)/signature masterpiece with Dune and Tenet. I love it.", 'Wooow literally a masterpiece denis villeneuve did a great job and the whole cast did a great job...also it was visually stunning....and the score was perfect for the vibe of the movie...and the CGI was Well done...i am very excited for part 2√∞≈∏¬§‚Äî I recommend watching it on IMAX.', "Visually spectacular but woefully tedious, portentous, pretentious, pompous movie. A reminder to be wary every time a director says that it's been a lifelong dream to bring a particular project to the screen. The result is likely to be over-reverence, as we have here. The real villain is the source material, which was already old-hat in the 1960s and now feels painfully over-familiar. Its sticky religiosity separates it from its predecessors such as Asimov's 'Foundation' trilogy. However much George Lucas may have taken from Frank Herbert, by creating the character of Hans Solo he saved the Star Wars franchise from being humor-free. There isn't a smile to be had from DUNE. Not even an unintentional one.As in all such epics, the actors who don't have to pretend to be real come off best. Fine talents such as Mr Chalamet and Mr Isaac, whose characters have 'journeys', do their best but inevitably flounder because of the drivel they have to speak. Simpler, two-dimensional figures, however, can give a well-cast performer something to chew on, and this proves to be the case with Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd, barely recognisable as the villain, and Jason Momoa, who is touching as a valiant and loyal soldier.Female characters rarely prosper in this latter-day Cecil B. De Mille style, so well done Rebecca Ferguson and Sharon Duncan-Brewster, who find ways to give the impression there might be life in the corpse of the genre.I was going to say that there's too much noise and too much music. But on reflection I understand that they drown out a good deal of portentous, pointless dialogue.Kudos to DOP Greig Fraser, production designer Patrice Vermette and their respective teams, who obviously worked tirelessly on creating all the worlds on display. But I'll never get back the two and a half hours I wasted on this nonsense. I resent it.And, heaven help me, it's only Part One!", "I mean wake ..My god make it stop.Inaudible bland dialogue. Constant exposition. Dull characters. Zero emotive connection to anyone. Run of the mill action. Substandard acting. ..Apart from that it looks extremely nice ...Probably the most painful experience I've had to endure in the cinema if I'm being honest.", "Cinematically beautiful but ultimately soulless.I thought this adaptation would be outstanding- the main flaws are the abject emptiness I felt watching it. There wasn't the world building or the touches to make the cultures come to life or the world feel truly lived in.Another major issue for me was the casting. I absolutely do not appreciate Paul Atriedes- I find his character is whinging and unconvincing as a 'prophet'. Also, we've now seen this before, done so much better in films like the Matrix.Another issue I had was that the Harkonnen family is all but absent with missing characters. I loved how campy and over the top they were with such disgusting and toe curling prescene in Lynch's movie.", "Before watching this I told my friend that I bet this movie, just like Blade Runner 2, is going to have beautiful visuals but painfully boring and drawn out. Turns out I was right on the money.I've been interested in reading the books, since they are regarded as classics. Fans praise the setting, the mood and the rich lore. But I have never heard any praise for the characters or the actual story. Having watched two failed (or are they really?) adaptations, I suspect that the actual story isn't all that interesting. The characters (a generous use of that word) certainly aren't, especially the wooden boy in the lead.At least the first movie took camp to a ridiculous level. But this installment is just pompous and dreary. Just because it's slow doesn't automatically make it profound.", 'Before watching the movie I thought the many good reviews of the film were fake, but after having seen it... this is hands down one of the best films of recent years!Superb visuals not just in terms of CGI but the graphic storytelling via retro archaic style of buildings, atmospheric settings and lighting and soundtrack, stylish costumes, spectacular desert landscapes and retro high-tech machinery, great cast and acting, clever story with intrigues and political backstabbing all work extremely well together.This remake is one of the few exceptions that by far outguns the original on all levels, and is sci-fi cinema at its best!Only negatives are: the movie\'s a bit drawn out in the end and could have been 15mins shorter. The "he\'s the chosen one.. oh but he doesn\'t look like it" mantra is a repetitive and a lame clich√É¬© - it\'s unnecessary to mention it and the story would work well (actually better) without random people constantly saying it. Also, the characters are a bit flat and linear and could have a lot more depth or controversy to them, indicating their motivations, inner tensions, what drives them etc. - so far the characters seem a bit like puppets on autopilot.But all in: amazing and potentially epic film and looking forward to part 2.', "I'll admit, I saw this movie for free, but only that fact keeps me from giving this movie one star. Where do I begin? Well, let's start with something that is ever present in this film, the most ponderous and headache inducing score in the last ten years. Overloaded with deep base, it wears on the viewer like a necktie pulled too tight. As is so common today, if your ears are more than forty years old, the dialog is so muffled by the soundtrack and special effects that you'd better have a good idea of what the story is about. Having seen the, in my opinion, superior 1984 film, I could easily follow the plot.What is disappointing is the real lack of surprise or originality added to the film. It may be a more faithful telling of Frank Herbert's story, but that doesn't make it more enjoyable. The characters are dull and cartoonish. The rendition of The Baron Harkonen is nothing but a carnival fat man. I could go to Texas and see the same thing at any all you can eat buffet. The 1984 Barron was magnificently evil, and disgusting. A truly memorable performance. The new film shows no dramatic creativity. No nuance. We don't even get to see the Space Navigators at all. While we're at it, let's talk about the Paul Attrades character. The first thing that comes to mind is the title character in the movie Edward Sissorhands. His makeup, facial expressions (of which an upturned right lip seems to be his maximum effort) are just boring. I did enjoy the performance of the actress who played the shaddat mapes. She was the most interesting of all. All the other characters in this film, just look like dusty unimaginative and uninspired bit players. This film is just a bathing suit full of sand.", "Which is no high praise for that version, but I'd watch it 10 times over this poor excuse for a Dune film (or any film). Don't believe the 10* shill reviews here (per usual, why doesn't IMDB do something about this; it's a huge problem), this is a real $165mil clunker. Yet another film in the current tradition of pure hype, throw money, have blockbuster, that Hollywood has become. This is such a disappointment. As someone who has read the books several times and a huge fan, uuuughhhh. It's really slow, been done before, and no real ending. I presume there will be sequels? I can see a lot of movie goers will be upset, esp after sitting through a terrible film, then no ending. And it's not always faithful to the books, in ways which don't add anything or move the film forward. And no Feyd!For faithful fans, the gold standard is the 2000-2003 Sy-Fy miniseries, which covers the 3 books. The effects are done on a TV budget, but the worms, palaces, and other sets are top notch. It is very faithful to the books while being well paced and absorbing. I own this set and have watched it many times over the years. With William Hurt, Susan Sarandon, Saskia Reeves, Ian McNeice, and Alec Newman, it's a top notch cast and the acting is great. Wonderful character creation by all involved.Conversely, the acting in this one is terrible and for some reason, a lot of yelling is involved. Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet is a very lackluster Paul Atreides and gives his usual childish performance. Oscar Isaac is not even effective as Duke Leto, and if Isaac is not good, then there are very deep problems with this film. Rebecca Ferguson rounds out the film as Lady Jessica, but she, too, is just so lackluster. These 3 have the bulk of the film, so the advertised actors are pretty much cameos, as the bait and switch by the studio.The effects and sets are unimaginative and have nothing new to show. The ships are ho-hum and don't seem like what Herbert described, and I never really saw the worm (will take a lot to beat the worms in 1984 and 2000 versions). I did fall asleep towards the end, so maybe I didn't catch the full worm. Even the Freemen blue eyes are terrible, for which there is no excuse. They use some horrible gray digital grading that just sucks the little life that there is out of this college project (and not even good for that). The desert is NOT gray! Plus the outdoor scene of the Atreides green home planet is not green.I can't believe that in 2021 they couldn't do a better job for a whopping budget of $165mil? This is a travesty of gigantic proportion! I doubt they will recover the budget and don't deserve to. Just no excuse. You have been warned. At least stay home and watch it on HBO, if you subscribe, rather than risk going to the theater and spending so much. Trust me, it's not worth it. This is the worst film of 2021 I have seen. Didn't help that I watched the gorgeous Foundation premiere right before...", "Dune (2021)By now, it is undisputable that Denis Villeneuve is a master of creating mesmerizing visuals and Dune is probably his biggest achievement as every single frame looks surreal. Frankly, I expected nothing less but ironically, the gorgeous visuals are also the reason for the film's weaknesses. On one side, they create an immersive experience; on the other, it feels like the director is trying to show off instead of crafting a compelling story for the audience to connect to. Nevertheless, it is a movie and it is bound to deviate from the source material so I will try to judge accordingly.While Villeneuve is an artistic genius, this isn't one of his personal art house projects but an adaptation of the greatest Science Fiction novel, which naturally carries expectations. The world of Dune is as complex as that of Game of Thrones where everything is intricately connected and the multilayered characters are filled with ambition; not to mention the philosophy. Unfortunately, none of this is created here and half of the big name actors are reduced to saying a few lines in favor of showing 15 pointless visions of Zendaya in the desert.By struggling to establish the characters and the narrative, the film ends up lacking a soul and as result, it is impossible to care about anything. Yes, every shot looks phenomenal but it doesn't stir a single emotion and no matter how pivotal the scene is, it just feels hollow. The excessive long takes leave little time for development and hence, key narrative moments end up being rushed. Even some action scenes feel underwhelming as they lack any energy and almost feel forced.Despite the anticlimactic end, I am eagerly waiting for Part 2 which will hopefully explain the world and allow the remaining characters to flesh out. Chalamet did a decent job as Paul but he needs to put on some muscle as he is pitiful to look at during the action sequences. At the end of the day, Dune is one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen with the aesthetics and sound being worthy of IMAX. Sadly, the essence and complexity of Dune itself feels either rushed or lost in between the grains of sand and the panoramic takes.Movies.shmovies in Instagram for movies and tv shows.", "If you know nothing about the books that form the Dune saga and care nothing about the man who wrote them, then you might enjoy this film.Alas, if you are a fan of Frank Herbert's work, this movie feels like a desecration of his legacy.Are the special effects good?Absolutely. They were able to use advances in technology to do things the 1984 film simply could not.While the backdrop of Dune is a bit stark, the visual aspects of this film are easily its most successful element.Unfortunately, beyond looking amazing, there is very little to recommend this movie.Is the cast good?Yes and no.They have attracted some enormously talented people to this project; however, several were clearly selected to push a certain ideology and therefore stand in complete opposition to the characters as written in the book.To be clear, they did not merely change appearances and genders, they altered the fundamental personality traits of several key individuals.Lest you think I am being too harsh, what bothered me about this film was not a lack of complete fidelity with the book upon which it was meant to be based.I recognize a to the letter translation of the Dune novels into cinematic form is simple not feasible.I do, however, expect them to respect the spirit of the source materials, which they did not.The people behind this movie obviously had an agenda and it was most definitely NOT to bring the Dune universe as Herbert created it to life.Most egregious among their abuses of Herbert's original text is that the changes they made were neither subtle, nor merely practical in nature.The deviations from the text present in this version were calculated to push certain themes that were never part of the Dune saga; consequently, they come across as ham fisted and almost profane.Personally, I also found the attempts to inject humor into this retelling of Herbert's story particularly off-putting and very poorly executed.I suspect there is a very good reason they decided to release this film internationally BEFORE they put it into American theaters.That reason being that Herbert's largest, most active fanbase is in the United States and they are not going to be comfortable with the way the makers of this film took liberties with his stories and the characters in them.My ultimate take away from Dune 2021 is that it is another case of the entertainment industry hijacking the popularity of an existing story to deliver their messages.That they waited until after Herbert's passing to use his vision to push their ideology reads as sick and supremely disrespectful.", "I was fortunate enough to get a per-release screening of this and I really enjoyed it for the most part. As with any book to movie adaption, I wasn't too thrilled about some of the decisions. The cast was well chosen. Because of the incredible leaps in CGI, some scenes were spot on. The acting was pretty spot on. Hans Zimmer did the music, but I found the constant presence of it a little on the monotonous side. I also could tell he paid homage to the previous movies, primarily the first one scored by Toto. The film also had moments when it dragged.I believe it will be well received when it's released.", 'The original Dune film created and released by David Lynch is undoubtedly a cult classic film. This 80\'s version of Dune was epic with grand visual cinematography, breathtaking costumes and a story that absolutely is a masterpiece. Where the original falls short is on flow and pacing. It dragged out in some areas.The new Dune film created by Denis Villeneuve contains many similarities when compared side by side with the original. In fact, the new Dune more closely follows that novel, and instead of having one long movie like the original, the new Dune fits about half of the original Dune story into a 2.5 hour film whereas the original fit the entire novel into that same 2.5 hours.The good news is that by splitting the novel into a 2 part film such as Villeneuve has done, it captures more of the novel in total. The result is a more detailed dive into the Dune novel that effectively eliminates many of the pacing issues that plagued the original film.The cinematography is next level on visuals. The world of Dune is breathtaking to see visually. The costumes are unique and gorgeous to view. It is very clear that Dune is a film with a massive budget...something that is quite rare to see anymore. Studios are more careful than ever when it comes to doling out the budget for blockbuster films anymore. In recent hits the only films with such large budgets are usually just Marvel films, so it is refreshing, unique and simply a visual treasure to look at this blockbuster film type that is actually filmed in IMAX for that incredible experience.We know the budget is there, but how about the story? Since this films source material comes from Frank Herbert himself, one simply could not have asked for a better story. In fact Dune is quite often hailed as the single greatest sci-if novel EVER created, and that is an accolade that is no small feat! The key was for Villeneuve to accurately convert that story into film accurately. I am pleased to say that this was clearly handled with kit gloves and deftly converted in a very effective manner. In my opinion we have an INSTANT CLASSIC film! The story and even the pacing is as close to perfect as many could have hoped!The acting and actors for Dune is simply a roster of some of the most talented A-list thespians on the planet! I could name this list for you here, but it is long and "star studded" as they say. The acting is fantastic and well performed across the board. The surprise performance out of an already amazing list would surprisingly go to Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin who brought "sizzle" t9 their respective roles! Additionally, the role of Paul by Timothy Chalomet was good but particularly Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica is a stand out for sure.This film is absolutely worth the money to go "experience" at IMAX. Notice I said "experience" as opposed to saying watch? This film in IMAX is just that type of film. Most people watch films, but Dune is a movie to "experience" if you are able to attend in IMAX. This show ranks very high across the board in every single category, but the entertainment value is particularly high, something that can be difficult to achieve in such a long run type film.9.5/10. I haven\'t really ever issued a perfect score to any film, but since I am unable to review score an IMDB film at 9.5/10, I then give this film score a 9/10 official review. I have only ever given out such a high score once, and that was for Game of Thrones who I rated the same. Do yourself a favour and view this in IMAX, worth every penny!', '+ Massive dimensions to highlight the Desert Planet and the Universe around it\n+ Epic music / sound supporting the epic scenes\n+ Book readers can be proud how the story is presented\n+ Excellent use of slow frames and bringing details to the forefront\n+ Cast includes multiple actors / actresses who fill the screen\n+ Select 3D if possible, it supports the movie and I forgot that I have 3D glassesFear is the mind-killer.', 'I\'m amazed at the amount of praise this film has received but it seems like many of those who are praising it loved other "questionable" films such as the star wars sequel trilogy, candyman remake, jungle cruise, and the countless disney live action remakes. There are some good things about the film but it tries too hard to be taken seriously and ends too abruptly all to "set up" a sequel.There was some great actor choices but others were down right horrible, like Zendaya who is supposedly going to headline the sequel!As a fan of DUNE and have never enjoyed anything other than the written material, I was really let down by this newest attempt.', "I have seen many reviewers write that this movies has no ending. That's true. BUT: The ending Denis chose seems perfect to me. There is no cliffhanger, no big question that I needed immediate answers to. This movie is about house Atreides being betrayed and the path this sets Paul on. This path leads him to his new home: Arrakis.In that sense, this movie had enough of an ending for me to not feel dissatisfied.That said, I will probably go and read the book instead of waiting 3 years (or forever) for the conclusion of this story arc.This is a movie of gigantic scale that feels so familiar, yet so fresh and and unique in it's own way. It's a 2.5 hour, polished piece of art and spectacle.I cannot recommend it more, and if you're hesitant because it's just part 1, don't be.I would give this an easy 9.5/10.", 'I felt like I was Paul Atreides - since my memories of watching the original 1984 film flashed before me as a visual guiding force while journeying through the desert planet of Arrakis. As a child, I loved the 80\'s aesthetic, the practical effects, and the over-the-top science fiction aspects of "Dune" - But I failed to understand the core meaning of the story. I\'m thankful for having had an experience with the mythology of this tale before since it helped navigate me through this new re-imagining. Which culminated in a surprisingly emotional and immersive cinema visit.All the exposition, all the time put into introducing the people and the worlds - It all continues building and building - Until all those elements find themselves holding hands - And your patience is rewarded with a feeling of relating to the potential of Paul\'s destiny. All of us are searching for what lies beyond that desert. Beyond that fear, a destiny awaits. And as they say in the story: "Fear is the mind-killer". Congratulations to Denis Villeneuve and his team! They nailed it! It made me reminisce on the past fondly, whilst also being in the present with eagerness to continuing striving towards the horizon. A very specific feeling, I know. But that\'s what the movie did. Plus, re-visiting that image of those iconic Frank Herbet sandworms echoed back souvenirs from a simpler time that I thought I\'d lost.PS: It was a bold choice to only adapt half of the book. Fingers crossed that we aren\'t left hanging with this cliffhanger. Much grandness is left to be witnessed.', 'Today I watched the most spectacular film I have seen all year. It\'s visuals are breathtaking, characters are well drawn (for the most part), and the allegory of the story (how spice and Arrakis are stand in for oil and the Middle East) is unmistakable. Hans Zimmer\'s score combined with fantastic art direction, and beautiful cinematography, all work intandem with Villeneuve vision as a director, to make this ambitious film worth the long wait, and a must-see in the biggest screen possible. The performances are all around great, although Rebecca Ferguson is the MVP. Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet acts like a sad emo for most of the film, but I suppose that\'s what\'s asked of him in the role. I don\'t agree with anyone who says the film is dull, but I suppose I am a sucker for the palace intruge part and all the politics, betrayal, and backstabbing, so the film having more drama and less action is fine by me. This is half a film (it says Dune-part 1 at the top of the film), so expecting a story that wraps up by the end of one film, is just as silly as being angry at "Fellowship of The Ring" ending with Frudo and Sam at the top of the that mountain looking at Mount Doom. I for one found this film very effective in building the world and preparing for the next part of the story, and I really hope we don\'t have to+o wait too long for part 2.', 'What does a good cinema experience need? Impressive pictures on a big cinema screen, a breathtaking score, a well structured plot, an incredible cast and brilliant set design and costumes to dive into another world? Dune has all of these and is one of the best movies you can watch in cinemas.I was born in 2001 and I\'m very sad that I didn\'t had the chance to watch Peter Jacksons "The Lord of the Rings" the very first time in theatres. I always wanted to experience such an breathtaking Epos by myself on the big screen. And I think I finally found my memorable cinema experience now with Denis Villeneuves "Dune"I have to admit that I never read the books of Frank Herbert, only watched the (not very good) David Lynch movie of 1984 but always have known about the impact of the novels to the science fiction genre. So it deserved a movie that can introduce the world of Frank Herbert to more people. And Denis Villeneuve definitly introduced me, and hopefully many others, into this world and made me want to dive into it and learn everything about it.PS: The first book is already on the way ;)', 'The story is slow and understood.At every moment you get what will happen next 10 minutes.Actors,,, cats and dogs would have act better.Definitely over exaggerating rated. No more than 2-3.I want my cinema ticket money back!', 'I first read the Book in 1981 at the age of 12, I know all the series and the history and lore it was the first sci-fy books I fell in love with. I knew the Lore it could not be made in to a movie. This is true the tech was not there.Well 2021 the tech is here and Denis brought the Dreams of this Sleeper to life. The scale was truly worthy of the story, I hate using the word "Epic" but in this case it is warranted.I gave it a 10 because we cannot give it a 9.5. It is not a perfect 10, there is issues with the story (There is a lot of backstory missing people who have not read the books will be lost because of) It really needed a Princess Irulan, Opening Monologue, the one we got was useless and a waste of bringing the casual audience up to speed.The story Moved along at a slow pace when so much more could have been added in that time instead of wasting it on to much of the "epic scenery / shots". Final draw back was way to much of of the Soundtrack, Most shows dont have enough this one was way to much which in certain scenes detracted from the Movie. Less is More in some cases and this one needed less Hans Zimmer.It is well worth seeing on the Big screen, then multiple times at home.', "Wanted something to happen. 15 minutes nothing. Half hour nothing\nThe end nothing.Huge snoozefest.Not sure if I watched the se movie as most.If there is a part two I won't be watching.", "One of the most well-paced and smoothest movies i've ever seen, didn't get bored at all during this epic experience, not even 0.1 second out of the 235 minutes. I was constantly looking at the screen, not blinking, just in awe of what was unfolding in front of me on the big screen.If only there was a part 2 I could watch right now ‚òπ", "First off, I have to stress that I have only seen about one half of the film. I stopped watching half-way into the film. I was going to stop watching already after about fifteen minutes, but I endured until roughly half, at which point I realised I would rather watch anything else.To say that this film is bad is to recognize it as an actual film, which it isn't. A film is a story being told through the film medium. However, I do not see a story here. Things do happen, but they seem random, incoherent, and as scenes follow one another, one does not get the impression we are being drawn into an actual story, into an actual fictional universe, with characters we care about. There is no intellectual or emotional investment on the part of the audience, because this 'film' makes it impossible. This is boring nonsense that one is incapable of relating to in any meaningful way.You know what the scenes in the film remind me of? A trailer. As if someone is showing you things and telling you that while it is all random and confusing, somewhere out there there is a movie that combines all this into a coherent whole worth watching. Action scenes and dialogue come across as footage filmed for the purpose of being used in a trailer. None of the dialogue seems to push the story forward or reveal something meaningful about the characters. Frankly, they could have all shut up and the film would have made just as little sense as it does with the dialogue.I am guessing that they are conducting a kind of social experiment, to see whether or not audiences will watch literally anything, however abysmal and lacking in meaning, let alone artistic value.Do not watch this even if someone pays for your ticket or buys you a DVD as a present. Every minute you waste watching this is a loss you don't want to suffer.", "Dennis Villeneuve's Dune (Part One) is an epic and glorious version of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi, and fully deserved to be seen - more than once - on the big screen. The sets, FX and production design are majestic, the storytelling strives for (and for the most part) achieves mythic scope, and it is truthfully a story that unfolds unhurriedly. Timothee Chalemet makes a good Paul Atreides, and there are great supporting turns by Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson and Dave Bautista. Zendaya makes for a radiant Chani, and the thunderous middle eastern laced percussive score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the overall feel of the pic. An instant classic, although I did find some of the action sequences a bit too dark. Here's hoping Part Two gets greenlighted.", 'To be honest I wasn\'t expecting it to be a first episode in the series of films, so that was a disappointment at first - but then I realised it\'s just impossible to put whole book in one movie in any meaningful way (with all my love to the Lynch\'s version, it didn\'t do the book much justice), so splitting the story into several parts is actually a good decision.Problem is, even with this division the film doesn\'t really provide much of the background details on who all the characters are, what\'s the state of the world, why spice is actually important to the navigators, who are the navigators and many many different important well-thought aspects that make the book so great. Instead there are long scenes focused on the main character, surroundings, futuristic machinery and so on.There are two more outcomes of such screen usage:\n1. It all looks absolutely gorgeous and amazingly well designed - "firefly" fighters are incredible, harvesters and their delivery is awesome, and many other things are equally stunning. And oh, the costumes! The costumes are the best.2. Major actors playing secondary characters don\'t get much time at all - they\'re all playing their roles very well, but we barely see them at all (save perhaps Jason Momoa, but even his screen time is scarce).Overall it\'s a great cinematographic feat, and the best Dune adaptation so far - but we\'ll have to wait the rest of it to see if it holds true. I only wish they\'d put more world-building details into the narrative...', "Worried like every time a great material is adapted it usually does not deliver on expectation.Here Dennis Villeneuve did the impossible: staying faithful to a complex and rich universe and a fantastic story with a masterful demonstration of direction, stunning visuals and solid acting.Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skasgard and Javier Bardem in particular are impressive while Chalamet was solid.My only (slight) issue is the fact that Lady Jessica is too emotional compared to the original character, and that we never see the emperor and the Navigators.I was afraid that the sex and race swap of Liet would feel forced and woke but it is well done and feels natural in the context of the film.So hat's off Dennis Villeneuve, this is another masterpiece under your belt.", "Dune is a masterpiece. As someone who read the books several times, I found the movie great at giving my imagination a more defined shape. I understand the purpose of these dream sequences, but they do sometimes get a bit repetitive and monotonous. Nevertheless, still one of the best movies I've seen in awhile.", "For those that have used the words 'slow' or 'not enough action' to give this film a lower rating, please remember there is more to the industry than the run-of-the-mill Marvel movie, and not every film needs to have a conclusion. Imagine a masterpiece like the LOTR getting a low rating simply because it was 'slow paced' or didn't have a proper conclusion haha.If you enjoy the art of storytelling; worldbuilding, character development, etc. Complimented with amazing acting, memorable scenes, and enhanced further through masterful cinematography and a legendary score, then this movie is definitely for you!I appreciate not everyone needs to 'love' this film as much as I did but at the very least you should also understand that a movie can be told over the course of a series rather than always having a beginning, middle, and end.Please try watching this film in IMAX for the first time, you'll thank me later!", "Just finished watching Dune part one. Just As Denis Villeneuve said , that this movie must be watched in IMax on the big screen.When I first heard about Villeneuves new project Dune I didn't know what it was . So I went to the Book store and bought first 3 books about Dune.I can say that I became a fan almost instantly.After realizing how good the 1965 Frank Herbert Dune really is , I hoped for Villeneuves movie to be as good visually and story wise as it was written in the books. And I was not disappointed.Every actor fitted their character. They felt real. Paul Atreides / Lady Jessica / Duke Leto Atreides / Baron Vladimir Harkonnen / Gurney Halleck / Duncan Idaho / Stilgar and Chani. Every actor was casted perfectly.Visually Dune was stunning. CGI was on the highest of levels. The experience of watching 2021 Dune in the cinema is beyond unreal.Still have the Hans Zimmer soundtrack playing in my head. The Theme is perfect. It completely take you and puts you in to the Arrakis where you fight for the survival every second.When the credits started rolling I understood that this movie was just too good to be called just movie.. Its an experience..\nReally would have stayed and watched the part II right away)\nAnd at the same time I was so happy that They divided the first book into two parts. That helps not to rush and gives all the necessary details to the audience. So we can understand every aspect of the story.The last thing I wanted to say.. Don't listen to the haters. We all remember what they said about Blade Runner 2049.. Films like this don't just come and go. Dune is here to stay.Go and see it yourself) it's worth it!Now We are waiting Mr Villeneuve for part II !Thank you for the Dune!", "This film was quite literally one of the worst films I have ever saw. It was 2 and a half hours of nothingness. Almost nothing happened throughout but people standing around having conversations with each other. Which also weren't interesting at all.I really wanted to like this as I love Denis Villeneuve movies.", 'My God, only 20 minutes into the movie and I was already mesmerized for the great masterpiece it is.The ambience, the music, the greatness of the halls, the unique take on the spaceships and tech... the list goes on and on.But the most astonishing were the Harkonnen. They"re now truly ruthless and savages psychopaths.Thanks, Dennis, for bringing such piece of artwork up to us.', "I was extremely excited when I heard this movie was being remade. Though I enjoyed the 80's version I thought with todays' movie magic it could be improved. But after seeing the trailers I had my doubts, which were well founded. I was glad I hadn't paid money to see this and waited for it to come to HBOmax. What Peter Jackson got right with the LOTR movie adaptations this movie gets all wrong. The movie is disjointed and confusing. The only reason I understood was because I read the books. I had to keep explaining the way things should have gone to my husband who was bored halfway through. To make a movie like this you have to be faithful and really understand the important things about the story, the 80's version at least understood that. I will probably do the same thing with part 2 wait till its on a streaming service. Too bad, really sad about this one.", "They missed it again. Massive visual effects ( that are really good ) , combined with dour acting within a confusing script. This made for a long , depressing , and boring movie . Perhaps Dune can never be properly made? The book never ends up on the screen . They end this movie in mid stride it'll be a couple of years to see part 2 , if it gets made at all .", 'I really hope the filmmakers of the Silmarillion movie (if it ever gonna appear) will do such a nice adaptation as did Villeneuve with this outstanding Dune.And for those who think Dune is very long I can only recommend TikTok.', 'There is no doubt in my mind that this film has pulled off one of the all time greatest devious licks. Just the way its able to subtly moisten you up and then actually ram it in you is insane. Awesome expansion of the Star Wars universe.', 'Okay, so I can understand the fact that this movie has no English in some parts, when it comes to space opera, narrative, culture, and tone. In its story, A boy who keeps having visions, an emperor Baron is obese with spice, Desert Gigantic Sand Worms controls the desert, and a race of people trying to fight against the emperor for their land and spice.Was it just me that I was getting irritated when scenes keep jumping everywhere. Every time someone speaks, all I hear is someone speaking in different languages, no subtitles sometimes.Action is less, narrative is slow, the badass and suave of scenes are dead.How are you supposed understand this movie? Who is it targeting? Lost my mind while watching.', "It was truly epic to watch this from biggest screen in the city.But it wasn't anything too mind-blowing.It got better from beginning.Story was more action driven so there wasn't that much character development.Score was really great.I'm kinda interested where this story leads i future.", 'Let me first say that I have an outsiders perspective. I have never watched a Dune movie before that and read none of the books. I am not even a SciFi guy. But boy did I love this movie. I knew that Denis Villeneuve was bound to do great things when I saw Sicario and Arrival.Everything clicks here. Great acting by the stellar cast especially by Timothy Chalamet and Stellan Skarsgad. Great world building. You can feel what the "dune universe" is like. Great storytelling especially because there is a lot to explain and so it is exposition heavy but never feels like that.And of course the visuals. This movie looks absulety amazing. The camera work, the costumes and the set design. Everyhting looks epic. And you never have that flat CGI look like in a marvel or Star Wars movie where you feel like you are watching a computer game or feel like actors talking to a fixed point on a green screen. And the Nolan apprach as I call it. You have main stream popcorn blockbuster topic but it also has different layers and themes. It is not just a bad guy having a MacGuffin to destroy the world.A great movie that will leave you wanting more.', 'Edit to my original review.I tried watching it again at home, in order to see if I would stay awake this time. I did in fact fall asleep again. The ever blowing horns and that √ºber slow pace, for which there is no apparent reason, makes for a really boring film.Yes, it is grand and the scope is huge.But in a time when sci-fi has come so far, this thing takes itself far too serious. Another Jesus story from back in the day, that someone think we need. Not so sure why, honestly.', "I can't say I'm disappointed with Dune, given the track record of director Denis Villeneuve. In the past, he has stooped to artsy garbage (Enemy), weak adaptations (Arrival, which avoids exactly those elements that made its source an unsettling classic), and hollow spectacle (Blade Runner 2049, an endless, empty, at times ludicrous mess).That said, I didn't hate Dune. I simply found it lackluster.The good: the visuals are splendid. The music is nice, though not exactly memorable. The narrative sticks wisely close to the book.The not so good: first of all, the casting. Not one of the actors in this film really blows me away. Paul Atreides, in particular, is far too weak to hold our attention. Not terrible, but at the same time not capable of suggesting the hidden strength that will soon make him a leader of men, a 'mahdi.' Jessica does a nice job with what she's got, but the script leaves her little to do but whimper, without suggesting the deep well of authority the character should have. The Duke Leto probably fares best, though again I think he's portrayed as a rather weak character, not the iron duke of the book.The worst: the pacing. I didn't find the slow, deliberate pace to be annoying. However, Dune the book is actually both dense and fast-paced. By taking the slow road, Villeneuve leaves no room for the background and character depth that's really needed for a proper epic. Grand vistas are not what make films like Lawrence of Arabia great - it's the deep, powerful storytelling. Even if Villeneuve was allowed to stretch this franchise to three films, it would be too late to fill in the missing detail in this first installment.I hate to think what anyone unfamiliar with Dune, the book, will make of this eye-candy adaptation. Probably, they'll wonder why anyone would bother adapting such a lethargic and superficial book. Dune the movie comes across as a Cliff's Notes version of the book: faithful, yet without any of the juice that make the book so compelling. See it if you have a spare evening, but don't feel there's any urgency about it.", '2021 Dune does opposite that 1984 version does; If David Lynch tried to put a huge story into limits of a typical movie length and failed, this one is going the other way and stretches it out needlessly. They could easily reduce all the "looking at the desert thoughtfully" and "What shall we become? / Hmmm / Fate will tell you"-type pointlessly poetic non-dialogs, make it either a hour shorter or pack in more content from the original story.The attempt is extremely beautiful to look at, does the world-building quite well, especially at first third of the movie, and doesn\'t cut too much out from the book. But the movie never gets anywhere, and amount of story that\'s shown could be explained with just ten sentences.Also, actors look quite sameish, with their metal rock band beards or bald heads and dull clothing. Nothing like the very memorable and colorful characters David Lynch\'s version or various video games did. That makes entire thing even more dull. Same goes with set/tech/clothing design. Every interior is dark and made of dull stone, spaceships look like giant bricks, clothing and armor is just grey plastic mass. I actually liked David Lynch\'s art deco craziness more.Acting is pretty good, although Paul Atreides comes off as way too horny and high on drugs sometimes, and Jessica Atreides constantly jumps between being scared out of her mind and then full-on Sarah Connor-type of warrior. It\'s way too extreme to be believable, since movie can\'t really show inner monologue, unlike the book, so it looks unbridged and random.Since the first movie tells so little, I would have preferred to wait until entire saga is out, and watch it all in just one go. Right now, it leaves sort of a bitter aftertaste, like you\'ve invested two and half hours, waiting for something to happen, but didn\'t quite get much out of it.', "Finally, a Dune worthy of Herbert's vision. Like Blade Runner 2049, it took me until the following day to fully digest the assault on the senses. The difference this time around, is that it reminds me of certain Euro art films from the 70s where there would be long close-ups of expressionless faces. Perhaps Villeneuve was inspired by Jodorowsky's Dune in the 70s that was never made, that was supposed to have Pink Floyd composing the soundtrack? Otherwise, it is very dark and brooding like Blade Runner 2049, and very much like the book and the mini-series (script-wise), but nothing like the 80s movie. Jessica is a little more vulnerable compared to her 'regalness' in the novel - at least, that's how I remember her from my reading the trilogy three times. And one person has changed gender! Dr. Liet-Kynes is now played by a woman. Regardless of gender, Max Von Sydow in the 80s film stands above the rest, because it is Max Von Sydow and his uniquely quircky personality that can give an added dimension to any role. If WB doesn't allow for a part II, I will never see another WB film again.", 'The sad news is that as boring as this film is, there will be more of the same. With all the "action" nothing happens. Timothy chalamet is out of his element here. Lots of people fighting over sand.', "(spoilers i guess... but not really)\nThe movie is great. Cinematography and acting is very good. The atmosphere is really immersive. Scenes are intense and fun. Its a really cool setting and it made me really invested in the story.

I'm glad I got to see this with a good friend named Joe he's great to be around. Anyway Denis Villenvue directed such a wild ride that enthralls you from start to finish and I would say there's no complaints Dune has everything you'd want in it! I think if anything I'd say I don't understand why so many people get up during the movie there was a big audience a portion of which got up often I'd much prefer being prepared to see everything. I loved Dune worth every penny.", "And why so dull? No rhythm changes, everything is told in the same tempo. And why now? There is no reason for this film now and the film proves that! No inspiration, no update! The same stuff just with more technical advancements. That's not enough to keep entertained or engaged! Slow in every way! Please no part 2!", 'I grew up watching the 1984 movie and had seen it a hundred times before I even knew the book(s) existed... :) so to me, this movie feels like "a remake" and not "a new adaptation of the book."Naturally, I can\'t help but compare the films.The pacing is much slower here, and I feel it gives the story a "proper epic" feel without going full Peter Jackson (The Hobbit/3 movies).There are enough differences between the two to constantly keep things interesting, though I feel some things are better explained in the 1984 version (less confusion and explaining things to my wife).Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this version, as I wasn\'t super-excited by the the first trailer.Given the strange economics of today\'s movie world, I\'m not sure how the studio will decide whether or not to go ahead with Part 2 ... but I intend to vote with my dollars by seeing this at the theater at least one more time.Thanks!', 'Flat characters and dull story telling.I was expecting a real block buster but maybe my expectations was too high.I was looking for more build up of the characters but here you find yourself right to the point.Slow pace story telling.The visual of the film is fantastic. And the.', "It's such a shame when brilliant directors like Denis Villeneuve start being given massive budgets to make films and start relying on that rather than good story-telling. The same thing has happened to Christopher Nolan. These guys started their careers turning nothing into pure genius. Now they just seemingly want to go out and spend a $300 million budget and forget that if your story isn't interesting then there is no point.Boy oh boy was this film bland. I was looking at the cast before watching the film. There are certainly some notable names, but I noticed a lot of them are also known for giving very dry performances. There isn't a lot of x-factor amongst them. That's very noticeable in the final product. No performance in the film stands out in any way.To be fair there isn't a lot of interesting things given to them in the script to work with. I was shocked how little character development there was. We are just thrown in and told to side with these people, but no justification is given for it. And because the film is so unrealistic it is impossible to relate in any way to what they're going through.This one wasn't for me. I hadn't exactly been itching to see it, but it was one that I had an outside hope of at least being entertained by. Not the case though sadly. A generous 4/10.", "A slow burner, it's not Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but epic in all proportions. Saw it in 3D but it still would have been just as effective in 2D. The story is true to the book, although I read it many many years ago, I think I'll be dusting off the cover and give it a second read. Just a couple of irritations, but quickly forgotten by the overpowering strength of the film. This was only part one, can't wait for the rest.", 'I really like Denis Villeneuve as a director, and was truly excited to see his version of "Dune". However, this is a drab, morose, self-serious misery. The film is completely lacking in joy or spectacle. Every CGI set-piece is obscure and dark and devoid of detail. Every performance is pompous and sour. The film is two and a half hours long because two hours of it is filmed in slow-motion. Movies like this are supposed to be fun. This was cinematic torture.', "I have long waited to see this new attempt at turning Herbert's book into a movie. The ingredients sounded promising (Villeneue, Zimmer, cast, ...) as well as the praise the movie has received so far.Trying to immerse myself into the universe the film constructs, or better, translates from the book, I need to say for me there is something missing. I've seen Lynch's adaptation, have read the book, and played the Dune games (esp. Dune 2) day and night in my teenage days. Maybe it is because of this background, that I felt empty during most of the runtime of the movie. The book is difficult to translate to the screen, depicting not only the political conflicts, but also the inner conflicts and motivations of its protagonists vividly.The movie tries not to deviate too much from the book's storyline, which I have to give Villeneuve credit for. But in contrast to Blade Runner 2049, the movie runs quite flat on the emotional side. But as said, maybe because I already know what happens next, and have already immersed myself into the imaginative Dune universe countless times, I felt like I was in a half-dreaming state phantasizing these visuals, but not actually watching a captivating story.There is little dialogue and another point of critique is Zimmer's work in this. Someone here wrote that he considers the Dune soundtrack Zimmer's magnum opus, but to me this was Interstellar (2014). The score in Blade Runner 2049 was already quite minimalistic, but I credit Zimmer for at least using the CS80 like Vangelis did, thereby finding the right sounds for the futuristic setting. But here, in Dune, there is even more absence of any theme/leitmotifs, it's just a combination of a few chords and drones which sometime do not match the film's flow, with some occasional ethnic vocals which are absolutely over the top. It feels like Zimmer tried hard to find the right music for this movie, but in the end, delivered something absolutely generic that a young aspiring composer would probably be ashamed of.Nevertheless I think I can recommend watching the movie, especially for people who have not read the book. I hope Villeneuve will be able to deliver the second (and third?) part, because probably it will turn out that the movie was deliberately filmed in the style of a two hour long prologue.Just do not expect too much; I think the praise that the movie has received on its own is a bit too much for the actual product, but in the end, let's see where this franchise goes, probably this Dune will be the perfect movie if seen as a part of a trilogy.", 'This movie was crab ass.I am just writing this as filler so I can post a review. This is absolutely dumb. The movie was poo cake. I have to write more because my review is too short.', 'Yes, it is a grandiose movie that lasted way too long building the characters. It is 147 minutes long with no end in sight and drags on and on with great music and great scenes of landscapes made out of pure CGI. Not sure why the rating is so high, but guess this sort of movie appeals to people who want to see some Oscars in the bag, instead of entertaining the viewer and keeping the action sequences flowing. The 1984 version was so much better, and if it had the CGI that is capable now, would make this version pale by comparison. Sadly, this is what the current audiences seem to want. Dave out!', 'Dune is a very interesting and vivid novel and story. David Lynch understood this and created a movie accordingly. Said movie was flawed in many ways, but, it got the main point correct.This variant of "Dune" is much less flawed. It\'s CGI is top-notch. There are no silly things. It smartly avoid showing the Navigators, which is so hard to do, and both Davind Lynch and the Dune mini-series do a pretty bad and kind of silly work on that.But, that\'s about it, for the good parts.Casting is _very_ wrong. Timothy Chalamet is too old to play Paul. He\'s also too tall, too skinny. Oscar Isaacs is no Leto, I don\'t care how big a beard he grows. Jason Momoa as Duncan is simply not sophisticated enough. Josh Brolin is probably the smallest miss, but, he, too, is simply not the high-ranking military type.By far the biggest miss is Lady Jessica. This is a woman of extra-ordinary beauty and grace. Rebeca Ferguson is not hard on the eye, but, that\'s simply not it. She\'s good at portraying skilled fighting women, which Lady Jessica is, but, it\'s subdued for her, and a lot of her success stems from it being such a surprise to everyone. Also, Rebeca Ferguson plays Lady Jessica as an emotional woman, which she is underneath, but she\'s very poised and almost stoic on the outside.Lynch did a _far_ better casting in 1984.The acting is also not very good. Lady Jessica we already touched, by Chalamet is simply too weird as Paul. At 25, he has no business being so childish, even though Paul should be 15 at this time. Even so, Paul is very much his mother\'s son, poised, but also takes a lot after his father, being ceremonial and a little stiff. Chalamet\'s Paul is a lost boy in a young man\'s body, disconnected from his parents and just about everyone else. Others don\'t do much, but what they do do is not very good or interesting. Aquaman has no place in this, especially not of Duncan Idaho.Story is not that much different than Lynch\'s first half of the movie, so we can\'t honestly say that it\'s closer to the source material. There\'s much, much more going on in the original novel and the choice of what to show is very similar in these two movies. Presumably that would be changed in the second part, where Lynch was forced to provide a more "impactful" ending.The pace is very slow, most of the time, but for no particular reason. Again, Lynch did a much better job. Conisder this: this is about 2.5 times longer than the first half of Lynch\'s movie, yet it gives only about 10% more content.The idea was probably to immerse the viewer in this world. But, it doesn\'t work. Not just for stuff already mentioned above, but because this world is too bland and uninteresting.Really, everything is grey, brown and dark green, with a few blue spots. There is no red, yellow, orange... Probably this was intentional, but it does not make sense, except maybe on the Harkonen homeworld.Also, everything is just so damn big. It makes no sense to create such large structures, it\'s simply way too wasteful.And what\'s with Navigators "finding way through stars" rather than "folding space"? Aren\'t the people who created this movie aware that there\'s a ridiculous amount of _empty_ space between stars, way to much to be hard to navigate? I know that "folding space" is not where mainstream SciFi went with regards to inter-stellar travel (it\'s warp engines, hyperspace drives and such instead), but, "folding space" is actually an important piece of the Dune universe.I\'m doubtful that a sequel could fix all this and it is the only reason I could think of to see this first part. Just watch Lynch\'s variant instead, ignore the silly special effects and some cringe-worthy dialog and go with it. It\'s much more fun than this and it\'s also more interesting and a better adaption of the original novel.', "For the first twenty minutes of this joyless nerdfest, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Then for the remaining two hours I was on catch up as the film went from one pointlessly long scene to the next. Obviously for fans of the novels, I was lost, and couldn't wait for it to end. 5/10.", "It's impossible not to compare this film with the book and the previous 1984 movie and in both cases it fails miserably. Apart from the special effects allowed by current technology, there are few redeeming qualities.Almost all actors severely lack charisma for the parts they act. The exceptions are Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho and Dave Bautista as Beast Rabban Harkonnen. These two are great in their parts although with little screen time and much better than the 1984 version.Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides and Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen are ok. But Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides is irrelevant.But when we go to characters like Thufir Hawat, Dr. Wellington Yueh, Reverend Mother Mohiam. Piter de Vries, Shadout Mapes and especially Dr. Liet Kynes they are a shadow of the 1984 actors. No charisma, presence or intensity.The worst is Timoth√©e Chalamet as Paul Atreides. The acting is a snooze-fest. Paul Atreides looks like he never had a good night sleep and just drags around. Completely uninspired and uninspiring.The 1984 version is far from perfect, but it transmitted a epic feeling, with strong characters and actors. This version even leave out some major lines of the book used in 1984 version, the vision sequences are bad and lack transmitting the background story of the universe where the story occurs apart a few comments.It's just too much style and little content. Very disappointing.", "I'm actually still in the cinema writing this review. It's been 1 hour 40 minutes and I started to read all bad reviews here on IMDB. Thank you to all those who wrote them, means I'm not alone.There won't be any spoilers here because I don't even understand what the hell is this mess that I'm watching! One thing I can say, student who wrote this lacks logic for sure - basically there is a world shortage of water yet main thing everyone wants to obtain is spice? Spicy food makes you dehydrated, duh, why you need spice if you don't have enough water.Also very loud movie, too many loud metal creaking noices.", "Sorry, but it was all visual effects and lifted scenes from Lynch's film (where he made scenes up that weren't in the book).The kid playing Paul was not a actor in any possible universe. He looked emo and that was about it. No charisma and no acting chops.Way too much CGI and wayyyyyy too much desire to be either a branch of the MCU series or the Star Wars mythologies. It felt rather desperate about these desires.Oh, the soundtrack was abysmal.", "This was by far one of the best movies I have seen in my entire life and it does justice to the novel.Screenplay, soundtrack, vfx... Everything was incredibly well put together. I have absolutely nothing bad to say and can't wait to see part two.If you love sci-fi or just, good movies, look no further.", "Between all the walking and WHISPERING. All the overblown visuals and stylized garbage that's been done over and over by this franchise.... Slow motion shots and total meaningless fluff , there's nothing worth remembrance. This is an excellent film to fall asleep to. Even in the middle of the day, you don't have to be Sleepy Joe Biden to find yourself snoring all the way to the credits. In other words.... Classic Dune. Why did I try this crap again?", "I have never read the book or seen the original film but I had the feeling that this film wasn't going to be my kind of thing and unsurprisingly I was right.This is the adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy .I didn't dislike Dune . I just found it incredibly dull.Sure it looks great and Hans Zimmer soundtrack is good but I found everything else hard work and to think that this two and a half hour film is just the first part !To say this is a slow burner is an understatement.My biggest worry going into this is that I wouldn't understand it . I was told by more than one person that the book is complicated and the 1984 film made no sense but I would say I understood 80% of what was going on which is Just enough .I'm not convinced Timothee Chalamet had a big enough screen presence to carry of the lead role and sadly the same goes for Rebecca Ferguson. Maybe it's because the graveness of the story made them look so miserable all the time ?It's been confirmed that Denis Villeneuve will be making the second part to Dune but I won't be rushing out to the cinemas to watch it .", "Dune seems to hold this flawed belief in which it feels that as long as the special effects and science fictional action is worth a viewing on the big screen, it can get away with a completely empty and boring plot. At the end, although there's a really decent cast and the film uses fine direction, it's entirely and utterly flawed.There is not one single moment throughout this entire movie that's anything near entertaining or even mildly interesting. The extremely slow runtime of far over 2 hours is absolutely and horrendously painful. Denis Villeneuve takes the story nowhere and leaves it feeling worthlessly uninhabited. Already, it's a very difficult movie to remain focused on with all the overextended moments relying on confusing dialogue and ridiculous features to keep a viewer's interest. Because of this, Dune is undeniably lazy.Timoth√©e Chalamet is forgettable in this movie. His performance isn't bad at all, but Dune absolutely crushes it with its terrible story. Sci-fi movies cannot get away just with decent effects, action, performances, music and other effective components, but the actual plot and design of the film can't be completely flat. Dune relies too heavily on great sound and visual effects, which is the reason why it's a messy waste of time.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.", '*Disclaimer* I have not read Frank Herbert\'s "Dune", nor seen David Lynch\'s cinematic adaptation. However, I have seen Denis Villeneuve\'s films, and have become increasingly amazed by his vision as a film maker.I saw "Dune" (2021) on a pre-release screening in Denmark, and although it comes on streaming as part of the contract, it is clear that Villeneuve intended Dune for the big screen. Once again, Villeneuve solidifies his masterful skills as a director, more so than ever in my opinion, including "Prisoners" (2013) and "Blade Runner 2049" (2017), as Villeneuve builds on increasingly sophisticated filmmaking. For film buffs, who have seen these film mentions, this is quite a statement on its own.Story-wise, this clearly seems like a prologue: Villeneuve is taking his time on character development and world building, immersing the viewer with technical perfection, be it related to casting and acting (excellent performances by the entire cast, particularly by Chalamet and Ferguson), pacing, editing, and oh my, cinematography. It is simply - and as usual - an awe-inspiring film to experience. Furthermore, the score is nothing short of phenomenal in supporting the cinematography, and in my book on par with rare examples of perfect cinematography-score collaborations such as "There Will Be Blood" (2007, score: Johnny Greenwood) and "American Beauty" (1999, score: Thomas Newman).Although it will obviously be relevant to fans, I also recommend admirers of technical aspects of filmmaking and film buffs to experience "Dune" on the big screen.', 'This is just a fantastic movie! Soundscape is perfect, acting good and the characters mysterious and likeable. The only thing that is negative to me is that it really felt like a prequel. I have not read the books btw.', 'Takes it time to actually build a story and not rush thingsgreat cgigreat musicnice fighting scenesgreat actorsawesome movie atmosphereCan definitely recommend it.', 'He said this in 2017 after BR49, he delivered. Now part two thanks!', "The biggest question with this film was: was Villeneuve able to deliver? You got one of the most popular sci-fi novels, a cast of talented and very charismatic actors, and a generous budget. Was Villeneuve the right choice to direct this film; could he muster all these resources and use them effectively to tell a story? Could he make a film that is enjoyable to watch and at the same time adapt a convoluted cult-classic on which numbers of filmmakers have stumbled?Turns out, the answer is yes.The real cornerstone of the movie, if you put aside the special effects, the plot and the visual storytelling, is the pacing. The film takes its time and lays out confidently most of the techno-babble and sci-fi jargon upfront. Yet, it is not boring or annoying. In any situation or scene, you know what is going on, who is doing what, and generally speaking the action is clear. That is something that was absent from Lynch's Dune. It is challenging to deliver a lot of information in a digestible manner, especially with the sort of sci-fi such as Dune. But the movie does it patiently and clearly. Most of the time a concept is set-up in one scene and then shown or explained in the next. Not only was everything clear in terms of stakes; but it was also engrossing in terms of tension. Not only do you understand what Paul is up against, but you want him to succeed.The story of Dune is the story of Paul Atreides, the young heir of a noble family. One thing that is cool in Dune is: it's feudalism in space. So, you get something that is closer to Game of Thrones than Star Wars.The movie follows the adventure of young Paul. How he makes the transition to a new world, has to come to grips with becoming a leader and is destined to become a prophetic messianic figure. That stuff is good, but I always thought it was the weaker aspect of the novel Dune. The story of a young boy who discovers awesome powers that leads him to rule the universe is pure power fantasy. It is more appealing to young boys than anyone else. Thankfully, the plot weaves-in the space politics and keeps your attention. It presents a lot of that messianic text in ethereal settings: dreams, distant voice-overs and flash-forwards. Leaving the primary action to focus on the back-room intrigues and political upheavals.Generally speaking, it takes the established source material, but paints it with the Villeneuve brush. The movie has that visually sleek minimalist style, where heft is rather communicated with sound. Those are the same ingredients that made Blade Runner 2049 a good movie. In many ways, this movie is more of the same, there is not much innovation stylistically. On the other hand, why change a winning formula?My only caveat is: You have to love sci-fi to like this. Your typical Grandma will not enjoy this.", 'I read the book a lifetime ago, so I don\'t remember the exact details, only that I was pretty overwhelmed by its epic scope. I guess the makers of this movie aimed to evoke the same feeling. And although I was totally ready to go for this, it unfortunately turned into a slightly disappointing experience.Sure, it\'s cinematographic awesome, the CGI and special effects are top-notch, the settings and costumes are impressive, and the acting by all major characters is great. But there should be more to a movie than "just" all that. What I dearly missed was some kind of soul in the story, an urgency for all the goings-on that should have been transferred to me as viewer.What didn\'t help was the extremely complicated background of the story, that only in (rather incomprehensible) bits and pieces was revealed during the run. Neither did help the fact that none of the characters was even remotely sympathetic, not even Paul, who as the meant-to-be pivotal hero of the story all the time stayed composed, solemn and rather bland.What you get is a mixture of GOT, Star Wars or LOTR, with the same well known ingredients: there are some evil powers that mercilessly suppress; a downtrodden community that rebells but lacks a leader; and a messianic hero that stands up to save the day; all of this covered by the usual sauce of exotic fantasy-languages, semi-religious rituals, some sorcery, and lots of massive battle-forces fighting each other to death. It\'s all familiar and done before, maybe not as grandiose as here, but in my opinion with a little bit more insight and depth.After two and a half hours I was left with the impression that I had only watched a long, complicated and slightly incomprehensible introduction to The Real Thing. Maybe that Real Thing is already in the making, they certainly alluded to it with the subtitle "part one". I do hope so for Timoth√©e Chalamet, I admit that I could watch his face for hours, but I so much had wished for him a more rewarding role to put his teeth in. He really earns a second chance.', "A long-awaited film that is unfortunately another in a series of watered-down PG-13 films and simply does not have the intensity it would have had if the producers had given the director freedom and an R rating.Visually the film is satisfying and the special effects along with the CGI are excellent, but the film is overall lukewarm.The fight scenes are bloodless and like we're watching a cartoon, and that makes the film look like another generic superhero story. The dialogue has been carefully modified to suit modern sensibilities, and thus the story has lost on an atmosphere that is already lukewarm precisely because of the PG-13 rating. Because it's not just about violence, nudity or harsh vocabulary, PG-13 movies can't have a dark and sinister atmosphere, and that's exactly what Dune was supposed to be.The cast is mostly good, Josh Brolin is great as Gurney Halleck, and Rebecca Ferguson is a great choice for the role of Lady Jessica Atreides. Lady Jessica Atreides is probably the best part of the film, perhaps the most convincing character.The rest of the cast consists mostly of solid actors, but some are miscast for their characters. Timoth√©e Chalamet is a great actor, but he just doesn't fit the role of Paul Atreides. Oscar Isaac is not bad in the role of Duke Leto Atreides and it is perhaps a pity that he did not actually have a bigger role.Dune is an adult story, and this film looks like a cartoon, without blood, without intensity and the necessary atmosphere that would make this film a worthy screen adaptation of this interesting story.The cinematography is great, as is the photography, but that's it. Denis Villeneuve is a great director, maybe even brilliant, but the PG-13 rating holds back every director and all he can do here is make the film visually great, and he did.Everything is nicely polished, but there's nothing beneath it, just another watered-down PG-13 story.", 'Beautifully filmed but never have I seen a more boring movie. Over-hyped and dull. Not a single star with great presence. If you are a lver of Star Wars or 2001, you can easily miss this film.', 'An astonishing transformation of a multi-dimensional and absorbing story into a painful eternity of mindless action, and utterly wooden acting. Pitiful.', "Magnetically beautiful and very rispectful to the book. Frank Herbert would have appreciated. Special effects ,production designer and costumes near perfection. A special mention for Thimothe'e Chalamet probably the best actor of his generation.", "If you don't let the CGI effects dazzle you and don't overlook the pale film characters, you won't have any fun with the film. The same thing I get massively from Marvel and it doesn't get any better by doing it over and over again.Conclusion: Visually great but very pale in terms of content.", 'I\'m not convinced Denis understands the concept of using "story-boards". This is a pattern in his movies. Most notably Blade Runner 2049 that makes \'Dune\' seem briskly paced in comparison. Ridley Scott directed the original Blade Runner into a cult film classic using his highly efficient filmmaking prowess, compared to Villeneuve\'s painfully long production cycle for BR2049 which turned out to be a plodding mess in which even the actors looked bored.Although an improvement over BR2049, \'Dune\' still plods along too slowly for my taste - it seems self-indulgent and condescending that Denis thinks we need all the detail of every expression multiple times to understand the scene - we usually get it on the first look, and "less is almost always more" (more engaging, more interesting, and more effective).It has been decades since I read \'Dune\', and there are too many scenes where I got lost. E.g. 1:10 - 1:20 marks in the film... Intentionally mysterious perhaps, but filling in some narrative details would help without ruining the suspense. It is this type of decision-making by Denis that influences me to lower my rating. It just doesn\'t work at all in film.This first installment of Dune would have earned a 9 with more prudent editing and narrative fill - I realize this slow story fill was intentional by Denis as he states "it sets the foundation of this world", and Part II "will be more of a spectacle" and "pure fun", but perhaps a reverse-Director\'s-Cut shorter version could be put together just to see how much fun THIS episode could be, and allowing some more story transparency.On a positive note, Grieg Fraser\'s dark moody cinematography deserves praise and was an impressive positive element of \'Dune\' - Bravo Mate! üëèI frankly expected Dune to be a disappointment after BL2049, but hoped Denis would change things up for Dune. This film is indeed better than BR2049 (which is at times unbearable), but he got only halfway to satisfying.Looking forward (with somewhat skeptical optimism) to the next installment of Dune now that the story\'s foundation has been so tediously laid out for us. We\'ll find out whether or not the "It\'s only the beginning" tagline of the film means he truly intends to change things up for the better (or that was a warningüòë).', "-I remember when i saw on my grandparents' house the first version,i was amazed by the story,acting and the costumes and even today it will remain the best boring movie of all time and the second version was more fast paced but it looked like a movie from Babylon 5 saga,baldish ,but it was pretty good although ,but this one,even if it has astoning visual effects ,it doesn't have the same impact for me as the first and even the second version,it is too boring (half of Dune's story in 2 hours and a half ?!?),even more boring than the first version,the music is too creepy and it is way too loud,and all i wanted to do on the half of the movie is to see the movie's ending,This is the best movie of the year,but i am not impressed. This is the Phantom Menace of the Dune's version. Dennis Villeneuve is highly overrated as a director.", "This movie spends too much time setting up and not being a movie. Right off the bat, and just like the Lynch movie, we're hit with a lot of information. And then there's more, then more, then more, then more and the movie is over. It never gets a chance to breath and just go somewhere. They were slaves to the book and didn't just make this a movie. This should be a 3 and a half hour movie instead of a 5 and a half hour movie. We don't need scene after scene showing why he's probably the chosen one. We only need one. We get it. We don't need the entire backstory of everything. So much could have be trimmed for the momentum of the movie instead of the integrity of the book. Then even when an exciting event happens it's also really boring.A good example is when Paul gets taken away with his mom. They kill the bad guys, crash in the desert, walk around, do the tent thing, come out, do the sand walk, see a worm that goes away, then find the desert people. 15-20 minutes for that to happen? We didn't need all of that! After a while I felt like some scenes were kept in just to make this movie long enough to be it's own movie so it wasn't out of balance with the next one. The next one, the next one. I'm sick of seeing movies where it's purpose is to see the next one.Too bad because everything looked so good. The ships, the costumes, the creatures and the perfect cgi. But the problem is that in choosing this path of excess they ruined all those good things. They put so much talent to waste. When they could have done what a movie is supposed to do and extracted the meat of all these things and condensed them into an enjoyable movie.It really felt like the Matrix Reloaded in many ways. Almost nothing but laying the ground work for the next one. But at least half way through Reloaded does pick up and actually goes somewhere. And you know has some of the coolest action scenes ever made. Then you go back and realize that you were just watching the first half of one movie. With Dune you know that and it doesn't help. Actually if this doesn't do well we might not even get to see it finished. And it's going to be years from now, not 6 months. By the way I love Reloaded.Another little thing that got me was the casting. All great actors doing a great job but they were all really obvious choices. I guess lazy casting. Again they all did great and I like them but I was kinda rolling my eyes at how obvious it wasI was really surprised at how much it was like the Lynch movie. I've seen that once and never read the book. I don't think that one is a very good movie either but I admire the ambition. They should have divorced themselves from being fanboys and focused on making a good movie.", "It's so good that I think it will find appeal outside the SciFi genre. The acting is top notch, sound visuals storyline and style all surpass any Marvel or DC effort out there. Highly recommend seeing it on a large screen!", 'I am surprised this is even categorized as being a movie. Presumably a movie has to have some kind or story or plot, which this didn\'t.It looks like an experiment in beautiful visuals, slow motions, and atmospheric music with more facial close-ups than LOTR 3, I was waiting to hear "my precious" at one point.Too much repetition of dream sequences and amazing long shots and great special FX, but under that, nothing, no great drama, no action, no real story of any kind.Why do movies make multiple antagonists look the bloody same? I am seeing battles going on and I have no idea who is who. Loads of different parties just sort of thrown together and fight with knives for some bizarre reason, who are mostly in suits and look like each other. What exactly is the point of the buzzy thing they turn on; it doesn\'t seem to actually do anything.Did I mention a space faring set of nations, use knives and hand to hand combat? I will again.The reason historically soldiers wore different colours was to avoid friendly fire. It would have been nice to know which side was which.So, you little bomb that can destroy buildings and ships, you have a portable laser that can cut through anything. Why didn\'t you just use those in combat to wipe people out, no, much safer to fight hand to hand with knives (got it in a 3rd time).Beautiful and technically well-made film, just like Blade Runner 2, but empty, boring, silly, and dull. Very disappointing.', 'Omg. What was that. Boring twaddle!Walked out before the end as life is too short & precious.2021 has been a terrible year for cinema & i mean the films.Nobody is by far, the best film this year. It puts Bond to shame no matter how much Bond makes incomparison at the box office.1/10.', "I've not read Dune, so I don't know how close it is to the book, so I'm going to have to judge it on its merits as a standalone film.And with that, this is going to sound nitpicky. If you've seen Denis' other works, you kind of know exactly what you're getting with Dune. That's not necessarily a bad thing; in fact I thought, as I saw the trailer ages ago, that Villeneuve was just about the perfect director choice for this movie, and after having seen the film, nothing has changed. Its just....Like, I get that this is set in the far future and ergo there will be lots of unique weird designs etc. But can we change it up a bit? And I would appreciate some spacecraft designs that make at least moderate physical sense, y-know?Although the movie clocks in at a meaty 2 hours and 34 minutes, somehow it still felt too short. Even knowing that this is one of two parts, I think that an extra half hour, Endgame-style, to flesh out a bit more worldbuilding and supporting characters would have helped a ton. A lot of characters' screen time felt comparatively way too short and you don't always know everything you would want to ahead of time. I would gladly watch a 3 or even 4 hour version of this movie.And while it was a wise decision to split a book like this into two parts it kind of suffers from Mockingjay syndrome where a lot of the movie is setup for part two. Don't get me wrong, a lot happens in the film, but once you watch it you will understand what I mean by that.That being said, the subject, theme, and visuals fit Denis' strengths as a filmmaker. I presume the flashbacks (forwards?) are part of the book's narrative as well. It is definitely a moviegoing experience and I am absolutely looking forward to part two.You already know the acting is impeccable with an all-star cast and the leads carry their roles. Timoth√©e and Rebecca are absolutely perfect.But I can't rate the film overall as high as some of the other folks here.TL;DR: Does Dune stand on its own merits? Yes, it does, but expect some mild d√©j√† vu. (Unintentional choice of words, but it's kind of funny that that phrase is also of French origin.)", 'We all know Villeneuve is an incredible director. Blade Runner 2049 is perhaps one of the finest movies of all time. In Dune, Villeneuve once again demonstrates that he is a directing genius. Dune has been widely considered to be one of the most difficult book adaptations. With much of the story told through exposition, such dense lore, and the magnitude of the universe, many believed it was unrealistic. They said the same about Lord of the Rings, but Peter Jackson proved them all wrong. Villeneuve has done that with Dune.Everything from set design, to costumes, to choreography, to effects, to score and sound, to (and especially) cinematography. Villeneuve does a masterful job of pruning the unnecessary exposition to focus on the core story, telling it in a dense but expertly timed two hours and 35 minutes. My wife, who previously fell asleep in Blade Runner 2049 and has never read a Dune novel, was rapt. I, who have read 15 Dune novels, was rapt. Villeneuve has somehow turned Dune into a movie with mass appeal, while staying true to the source material and giving fans everything they could have ever asked for.Villeneuve took the bold action of writing "Part One" on the title screen to ensure audiences understand that this is the first part of the book; but also to perhaps place some additional pressure on Warner Bros. To green light part part two. It will be an egregious injustice to the universe if Villeneuve is not granted the right to produce the second part of this movie.I watched this in IMAX and cannot recommend the experience highly enough. The soundscape was awe inspiring. I will be watching this a second time in IMAX.This movie is 10/10. I have extremely minor nitpicks which are not worth mentioning. Villeneuve has cemented himself as my favourite contemporary director and I look forward to watching anything and everything he should create in the future.', "The only problem with this movie is that it should clearly be rated r, but its not hence its so noticeable and it really takes you away from the movie. The language used to the killing and stabbing. Everything looks fake as they really go out of their way to not show any blood or use swear words. Its really pretentious, sad and pathetic, as it takes you out of the movie everytime there's a fight scene.", "This would be a good movie... if it was a sequel. It really feels like this movie starts in the middle, not at the beginning. Where's the world building? Where's the character development? Nope, instead we jump straight into the action with no buildup. Also, did this really have to be 2 and a half hours?I feel like this would have worked better as a miniseries, where the first few episodes developed the characters and the world.", "Just watched this movie in the cinema.The visuals are amazing. This movie looks amazing and it was a great experience.But the movie lacks Emotion. I never really got emotionally involved, and thats sad.Still, it was a great cinema experience and I'm looking forward to the second part, which I hope will come.", "The film is visually spectacular and if anyone is asking if a remake was necessary I'd say yes just for the technological advances there have been. We finally get a real feel for these locations, something that neither the original nor the mini series can offer to 2021 audience. Anyone unfamiliar with the book or previous versions may find themselves a little confused about the different groups and planets etc as not enough time is spent developing those aspects. People may also be disappointed to realise it's only the first part of the story. The cast is pretty solid with a few underutilised, but the visuals are what give this the 8 stars, that and the fact I am a fan so for me I wasn't confused by any of the plot. Fans of Dune will want to see the continuation of the story, I'm not sure however how good a job it does of winning over new audiences or those previously unaware of the franchise.", 'Grand epic of caliber that very few movies achieved before. Amazing adaptation and true love letter to the Dune universe. Must see not only for a Dune fan but for any sci-fi enthusiast out there.', 'Wow what a movie this is what we call a epic film, visuals, actions, special effects, acting, story, music everything is 10/10.', 'If there ever was a film you should see on the big screen, Dune is it. The production design, cinematography and score are epic movie at its finest. Solid performances from the entire cast as well. Storytelling: it starts with a bit too much exposition and world building (perhaps a novel like Dune is more suitable for a series, like Game of Thrones) but once the action kicks in, it is a great rollercoaster ride. Bring on part 2!', 'What an Amazing piece of art by Villeneuve. Superb Cast with a very strong performance by Chalamet and Ferguson, Excellent Special Effects and costumes.The direction by Villeneuve is elegant, maybe too slow in some parts but overall very good.Surprised for the role of zendaya, very limitated in this first movie but maybe it would change in the sequels.Hoping to not flop at the box Office because it has the potential to be the best sci fi saga ever Made.', "As a first chapter of many upcoming movies I don't know how many dune was excellent and denis villanuve present this awesome universe make me feel that dune after 30 years will have the same level of Lord of the rings and Harry Potter\nThe cinematography was insane as usual in denis's movies.The acting was great specially Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson\nCan't wait to watch part 2.", "Like Apple's Foundation fails Isaac Asimov, Dune fails Frank Herbert. Special effects are good, that's about it. Disappointing.", "I just love the cult classic Dune of 1984 and was afraid this remake would not live up to that standard. I was not disappointed, great cast, very good special effects and entertaining. If you know the story you know that the 'spice' is used for space travel, without it it is not possible. This movie lacks that it does not show the space travel with the spice, where the 1984 edition did, that was fairly disappointing. But the positive side on the 2021 version is that the story is explained much better. So overall, even if you love the 1984 version, or did not see any Dune movie/series ever, this movie is worth your while.", "I'm sorry but this movie is terrible! Boring storyline, boring and I mean boring dialogue and very boring characters! I was expecting so much more from this, very disappointing!!!", "Finally someone has understood how to give this monumental and at the same time profound story an adequate visual form. And not only that, also the intensity and epicness with which everything plays out, from the quiet to the loud moments. The feeling of the drama in the making until the great catastrophe. The subtle to aggressive manifestation of the witchcraft forces.Together with the fantastic actors and Zimmer's music simply the highest pleasure and worth at least one more visit to the cinema before it comes into the home media library.", 'I enjoyed the entire experience from beginning to end. It was done better than anyone couldve asked for and better than i imagined. There are stuff in the book that cant be adapted but the movie did well without it.

Its the fastest 2.5 hours movie ive watched in memory and i couldve easily watched both parts together easily.', "Slow burn my dude's. Pls watch the orginal. The movie is long and just an introduction to a franchise that may or may not get a sequel. I hope i am wrong.", "Is it a good, fun and visual stunning movie? YES, without doubt. This is by any means a slow burning sci-fi opera with one of the most beautiful cinematography in history. Is it a masterpiece? NO, absolutely not. I'm a huge Villeneuve fan. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most underrated movies in years in my opinion. The atmosphere he created there almost was perfection in it's finest form. Somehow he tried to do something similar in this movie, and it just didn't work out for the best. Visuals are important and are decisive factor for the atmosphere in the movie. Villeneuve does this as none other. You will be flabbergasted at many occasions. This in combination with the sound mixing and music by Zimmer really works out well. I love how he captured the somewhat religious vibe in the costumes and decor. Not many movie directors are able to let you believe this world could very well exist. The architectural minimalist approach of the decors really help to get you into the story. And here is where Villeneuve gets it wrong. Somehow the story never really gets launched. Mainly to do with too many bleak characters who are not able to carry the story. This results in a visual stunning sci fi opera with not too many story. And the little story you get is just too little. If you have not read the book you will leave the theaters with the feeling still not knowing what it was all about after 1 1/2 hours. The main problem was that Villeneuve couldn't decide where to end part one, resulting in a messy plot that wasn't a plot.Still I absolutely adored this movie. Because of the excellent atmospheric style in the movie you could not, not be mesmerised with what was happening on the screen. I have big hopes for part 2 where the story will actually really start. Perhaps splitting this movie in only two parts wasn't the best decision. Many people claim it was to slow. I think it was not slow enough and should really have focused more on an audience that doesn't know the full story.", 'Mind numbingly boring & drab,Dune is the perfect antidote for insomnia.While the cgi, cinematography & sets all look excellent none of it can save a movie with such a dismally uninteresting story.Dune is the cinematic equivalent of the proverb " you can\'t polish a turd".With more pointless "slow mo" than the entire fast & furious franchise & every actor delivering performances as if they\'d been deprived of sleep for days, this reimagined /rebooted version of Dune looks to be more of an Apple TV + show than a big budget theatrical movie release.The highlights of the movie was the introduction of a "sand mouse", a very cute, excellently animated creature of the desert with the depiction of the gigantic "sand worm" being slightly less interesting.Dune\'s comic moments, albeit unintentional was the interesting looking but ultimately silly "dragonfly helicopters" which looked more at home in a children\'s animated cartoon show & the phrase "desert power" in reference to an individual riding on the back of a giant sand worm "surfing" the desert,\nboth silly when uttered & witnessed.Denis Villeneuve\'s 2021 version of Dune is no better or worse than David Lynch\'s 1984 offering but lynch\'s Dune is delivered with fervour & gusto & it\'s actors portray the characters they play with the depth & drama befitting a blockbuster sci-fi drama whereas Villeneuve\'s version is delivered with all the excitement of a "damp squid" & it\'s actors delivering their performances as if they wished they could be anywhere but on the set of Dune.Villeneuve looks to have decided to attempt to mimick the epic "Lawrence of Arabia" for his version of Dune, which the memoirs of T. E. Lawrence was in part the inspiration for Herbert\'s original story, but Villeneuve\'s version has nothing of the spectacle or grandeur of that movie.There is no doubt that Frank Herbert\'s Dune novels (1 thru to 6) were epic in their world building & the other 15 or so books expanded even more to the before, during & after of those six novels but all in all its a matter of preference when it comes to any genre & the story therein, Dune is inherently boring & Villeneuve\'s version is no different, suited more to a dreary TV drama similar to "Raised by Wolves" or the slightly more interesting but no less dreary "Foundation" than a "blockbuster" movie.', "Maybe cine-tech advanced enough or adopters realized it would not be enough to have a 2-hr movie even from a single book, this one is definitely the best adoption for me.One crucial criticism would be if this movie will be comprehensible for the ones who haven't read the book(s). That the whole movie jumped into action as soon as it started will be something hard to catch up for the ones not familiar with the first book or the Dune saga.I would really recommend a read at least of a synopsis of Dune before watching, to understand the background, the Houses of Corrino, Attreides, Harkonnen, Bene Gesserit, Space Guild, and what spice melange is.", "I honestly don't know how anyone can sit through this snooze fest and like it?It seems like Hollywood can't make entertaining movies anymore. Just endless scenes of uninteresting and badly written dialogue. Virtue signaling. Then some try for an action scene in front of a green screen, with everything color coded to black, brown, and blue. Such a waste of time and money.", "Just watched one of the first screenings of 'Dune' at an IMAX cinema and damn, that were some of the best two and half hours of my life. I was hyped for this movie from the moment it was announced since I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve - but also because the story really spoke to me in a special sense. I haven't read the books, so this experience was very original and new for me.I was amazed when I heard about the amazing cast that was going to be in this film. When I saw them in action I was even more amazed, overwhelmed even. Every one of these top-tier actors brought their A-game to the set of 'Dune' and this makes the characters so much more interesting. The person the amazed me the most was Rebecca Ferguson. Her portrayal of Lady Jessica was absolutely outstanding.The visuals and cinematography in this movie were out of this world. You'd almost think that they actually filmed on different planets. You could pause the movie at any point in time and you would always be looking at a beautiful painting of its own. The sets were incredible, so were the special effects. You can really tell people worked hard on this.Hans Zimmer's score was pristine (as always). It really brought the universe of 'Dune' to life by creating a unique atmosphere of its own. The sound design was also incredible. I was a big fan of the loud, obscure sounds that were coming from many of the gigantic ships. It really gave you and idea of how large in scale this story is.As far as the story goes, I don't know if I can give a good opinion. I haven't read the books nor watched the previous adaptions, so I don't know if this adaption stayed true to the original. All I can say is that this story really pulled me in from the get go and didn't let go until a few hours after the movie ended. And I'm still not over it. I rate this movie 9/10 because I absolutely adore it, missing the one point because the ending didn't really feel like an ending. I truly hope part two gets made because this story deserves to be completed.", "So disjointed and hard to follow some really bad casting choices and unappealing acting.Id rate the 80's version better than this mish mash modern trash offering of a classic novel.", "I wasn't a big fan of Dune when I read it. It was like a sci-fi/fantasy take on an old sword-and-sandal political intrigue thing, complete with dull characters and dumb story.On the other hand, it had this wonderfully anthropological creation of a desert world and its people. That was the only reason I got through it.Dune Part One is the first part without the second part. The characters are still dull, the plot still dumb, and the sci-fi world-building almost non-existent. The scenery and special effects are quite good, but nothing is interesting; even action scenes are listless.Will Dune Part Two offer the world-building that was the only good part of the book? Doubt it. Anyway, I certainly can't take any more of this.", 'Sand. Sand. Gray color. Depressed people. Bunch of made up names for places, people although they all look the same. Some authority figures to give some legitimacy to what meaningless words they are making up. Unnecessary close up shots for the sake of close up shots. So far 1 hour into the movie and totally meaningless. Did I mention that it is very slow? I can make myself coffee while the camera is zooming into a scene.', "I can see why some people like this film. But how does it have a rating above 8 stars. Ya, it had great cinematography and special effects but man this was boring. It probably took me 4 hours to finish. The story just couldn't keep my attention. Every 10 minutes I'd have to rewind and re-watch the scene just so I could follow the storyline. I honestly couldn't wait for it to end. Not a film I'd watch again.", 'The fact that I am more than 1/3 in, and outside of Batista\'s emotional outburst, this has been flat and dull.I have a Sony Bravia A90J OLED Master Series with Dolby Vision, and until they reach the Planet of Spice the lighting is almost as bad as "Winter is Coming" GOT season 9. Because it\'s 2.5 hours, if this doesn\'t pick up by the 90 minute mark I\'m not finishing this so far overhyped nonsense it\'s a total snore fest.I made it through the first lame battle and to the 1hour and 20 minute mark, and I\'d rather be in that Desert running from giant sand worms than finish this mind numbing garbage.Hollywood some books are not meant to be films period.Why anyone would consider this any better than a no name low budget Netflix film is beyond my mental grasp.', "I felt nothing when Duke Leto Atreides was betrayed by Dr. Yueh, or when he sacrificed himself to kill Baron Harkonnen. I got nothing from Lady Jessica when she realized he had died (did she even LOVE him?). I felt no surprise when Baron Harkonnen survived his assassination attempt. I felt nothing when Duncan Idaho fought to his death. I felt nothing when Dr. Kynes died. I don't even remember if Gurney was killed but I assume he was. I felt nothing when Duke Paul Atreides was accepted by Stilgar as a Freman. This movie absolutely failed to resonate with me on an emotional level even though there were so many opportunities to do so. The acting was suitable but not inspiring (maybe the casting choices could have been better, too. It seems the casting director aimed for familiar stars from Star Wars, Marvel and DC instead of truly fine actors that are lesser known). The screenplay was a decent adaptation- if and only if there really is a Dune Part Two; otherwise it's an incomplete and unsatisfying story. But it is certainly the director's fault for a distinct lack of emotional resonance. Denis Villenuve is a competent director, but a cold and calculating one. It's well produced, with amazing set pieces and costumes and cinematography. Maybe I expect more from Denis Villenuve since he works on films with grandiose visions. I just wish directing for emotional drama was in his tool bag (it's not).As for the story, I hope there's a sequel because this film simply does not work as a stand alone film. It ends on Act II with an unclear path for Act III. This really should have been a 3 1/2 hour movie that finished with Paul Atreides leading the Freman to retake Arrakis from the Harkonnen. In other words, it should have followed the same outline as Dune 1984. And that's why I still prefer that version to this; it's simply a complete story.", 'If you are going to make movies with freaking cliff hangers have part 2 available with six months to a year! That crap is ridiculous have to wait until 2023 for part 2, are you kidding me! Work on the side by side and have them released closer together. Sheesh!', "Amazing movie but Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet not fit for the role. Zero emotinally, he seem distant and emotionless. I know it's an adaptation but the missing parts from a book in a movie left the feeling something missing. Even if you didn't read a book. It wasn't bad, for someone who read the book will definitely miss things out of it - as well. For example, Jessica in the book is a strong woman, calm and perfectly trained Bene gesserite. She doesn't fall by itself. The director, seems in this film -and his other movies as well- that he always omits the essential things from his films, that's why his movies looks empty, only those who read the books can understand and see what I missed and so many others too. Either that was it or he got empty inside over the years, I don't know but he should pay attention to that. Not only the name matter but also the content too. I have read all the Dune universe books. I know who is who and what will happen. I also missed some elements. But total, it didn't get bad. I'll give a strong 6/10 or 7/10 - if I'm forgiving. But because of Jason Momoa the Dune received 10/10.", "Beautiful and sophisticated as others have stated, but lacked enough action sequences to keep me from frequently glancing at my watch. The casting and acting was also strong, however, several of these characters didn't appear to have much to do. I respect that it was a mature plot that had substance instead of explosions and an over abundance of fight scenes, but it needed some faster paced scenes to keep it from becoming monotonous. An hour and 15 minutes in, nothing significant still had not happened.", "I am generally very critical of movies based on books, and definitely did not like Villeneuve's Arrival at all. In this case, as has been said frequently, it is a tad slow paced, but the cinematics, the cgi, is flawless. So many takes are works of art, it is a beautiful movie, there is no doubt about that. The plot does stick mostly to the books, it is enough and sufficient for it to be called Dune, not for example what has sadly happened to The Foundation. This is a take on Dune, there is no doubt about it, but it is a subdued take in terms of plot and the strangenesses (new word) the book has. There are a few missed opportunities, with the Harkonnen, the Sardaukar, Navigators, etc. By this I mean that although the uniforms, the visuals etc. Are amazing, the 1984 movie was much more weird and intense in terms of portraying a foreign or future universe. This is much more mainstream, the plot could take place in any average sci fi world filmed before. As amazingly grandiose as it is, it lacks Duneness (new word again), I would have hoped for a bit more spice in the movie.I will watch it again, as it is a very good movie, and would be quite awesome were it not for the book it is based on. But, having read the books (all of them) multiple times, it does fall short when compared to them. I would place it between the TV series and the 1984 Dune, closer to the original movie than the series, as it is stunning, but not as gruesome and intense as it could have been. The fremen also lack a bit of punch, I will not go on, as I think the point is made. Looks amazing, but lacks a bit of spice.", 'Since this movie is getting a lot of rave revies I thought I\'d share my thoughts on why Dune didn\'t do it for me. First of all: I haven\'t read the book and wasn\'t familiar with the source material when I went to watch this movie (Edit: I have read the book now and liked it even less than the movie). The visuals, as expected, are very good and there\'s nothing more to say about it, really, than that Dune worked very well in terms of visual appeal. The problem I have, though, is that the movie - while undoubtedly pretty - made me feel nothing. The protagonist, Paul Atreides, is yet another chosen one who spends a lot of time staring melancholically into space and has a lot of visions of Zendaya (like, a LOT of visions of Zendaya - I guess they had to force in as many visions as possible to justify her having been marketed as the female lead of this movie, which she\'s not). Apart from Paul and his parents Lady Jessica and Duke Leto, pretty much everyone in this movie felt underdeveloped or downright stereotypical to me. Most side-characters (played by well-known and talented actors) are barely even characters, because they have no personalities asides from basic character traits like "grim soldier" or "Asian doctor". When a character I know nothing about betrays other characters I know nothing about later on in the movie, I just feel nothing, because I don\'t care for these people even the slightest bit. The same lack of development goes for the villains, only that it\'s even worse. The villains in this movie are some of the most stereotypical I\'ve seen in a long while. Nowadays I just expect more out of a villain than "he\'s evil and power-hungry and kills people" - that\'s a character trait basically every villain comes packaged with anyways. To emphasize that these are the bad guys, they live on a cold, dark evil-looking planet and they for some reason have a huge spider as a pet that serves no other purpose than to show us that these people are EVIL. The only character in this movie that exuded any life whatsoever was Jason Momoa\'s Duncan Idaho, even though I\'d still call him underdeveloped. Overall, this is objectively not a "bad" movie but it\'s also not a movie I enjoyed or see myself ever rewatching again and I won\'t watch possible future movies in this franchise either. I always have the feeling with Denis Villeneuve movies (like Blade Runner 2049 and now Dune) that by putting in as much pompous and convoluted dialogue as possible and wrapping everything in overwhelming visuals he tricks us into thinking we\'ve just watched a highly intelligent cinematic masterpiece when in reality, this movie could\'ve desperately used some character work, emotion and better pacing.', 'The Gom Jabbar scene was terrible, a low-rent version of the original and omitting some important dialog. The actor playing Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) was plain compared to Francesca Annis, who played the original beautifully, with her exotic looks. Costuming was poor, casting was poor. A big disappointment.', "After an hour (which felt like two) the combination of stale dialogue, snail-pacing, dull exposition and SAND makes this film more like a cure for insomnia. The at times beautiful images don't make up for its lack of intrigue.", "This is a breathtaking movie. Visually a masterpiece. Wonderful cast, especially Rebecca Ferguson. It is a treat for fans, you can even see glimpses of Alia very early on, which makes me longing for the full series. It is visionary, perfect pacing and setting up the scene for what is to come.But, and here it comes: when the movie finished, a guy sitting beside me started complaining that he doesn't need a next chapter, because he already almost fell asleep watching this one. And my fear is, that a majority of people will see it that way. Because many have forgotten that sometimes a story needs time, characters need time and also we as an audience need time to arrive in a universe as complex as the Duneverse.So my hope is, that also a majority of people will love it the way I do. And that Denis Villeneuve will bring all the books to life. But in the meantime: Thank you Mr. Villeneuve for this movie. It was the first one I saw in a cinema for almost a year. And it reminded me why I love going to the movies.", "I didn't see the first one from the '80s but this one I totally loved. A great sci-fi movie, a crazy cast, a totally gripping story and amazing music. Waiting for more.", 'As a 70-year-old film fanatic, seeing Dune for the first time impressed me at least as much as my first encounter with Lotr or Star Wars. The dark and austere visuals, far removed from the previous film version of Dune, contributed to this "epic" feeling. Classy.', 'Great!! Dark AmbianceThe sound effects are too loud, give a break to our ears please, so that we can warch a story.', 'Nitpics aside, this is a movie with amazing production design, a powerful score, masterful visual effects and phenomenal perfomances. As a fan of the book I can say that it delivered the story in way I didnt expect. It streamlined certain events yet managed to communicate the core messages of the book.I do believe however, that the soundtrack albeit BEAUTIFUL was sometimes undercut by the excessive ambience.(It didnt bother any of my friends though, so it might be a ME thing). Also ,I think that we could have had the ending about 10 minutes earlier. Some say that it ended abruptly but in all honesty the point where the story stopped seemed logical to me. It might be because I have read the book.It was a long ride but a suspenceful one. It might not be for everyone but it certainly was for me.Overall, It is truly a testament to the potential of science fiction and I cant wait for part 2.', "DUNEthere's too much missing\nPaul Tim Chalamet is an unknown\nKyle MacLachlan was far better choicePros\nThe Dragon Fly Ornithopters are way more like the book as appose to the original movie.ConsI've read 4/6 books, no mean feat for a Dyslexic.

The flow of the story is continuous, the tension is kept throughout the movie. I have to applaud the costume design, because they managed to make every aspect (characters, places, ships) sparkle and shine. One thing that might let some people down is the fact that the trailer makes it seem like there is a lot of action in the movie. What I found was that, while there was action in the movie, it wasn't as much as the trailer led me to believe. Any fan of the book(s) will absolutely be content with the movie.", "I think that I got disappointed at first because I didn't get all the answers that I was looking for. But after I remembered that it is part one only I recognised how amazing it was. I wished that they made it a Tv-show. I believe that I will get to enjoy more as a series.", "I found it boring and mediocre. Very good music and cinematography, but the script pretty dumb and direction weak. I think it's by far the worst Villeneuve's film so far, I liked much more all of his previous films, especially Incendies and Sicario.", "What we are witnessing is the birth of a mythical cinematographic saga which differs from the pretentious blockbuster sagas by its depth. Denis is a genius and he was able and knew how to take the time to set up a universe this astonishing and beautiful. The worldbuilding I just so perfect that it seems entering a real historical event in another universe. And for the aspect, the shots are grandios, magnificent landscapes which transcribe the atmosphere of Dune so well. The storytelling is done wonderfully. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is so surreal that it accentuates every aspect of this complex mystical universe. The performances are incredible. An excellent casting indeed especially Timoth√É¬©e as Paul.Dune is not just a sci-fi movie. It's an art. An art that needs to be witnessed. It's exactly what cinemas are made for. Spend your money on this. Watch it in theatre.

This is a masterpiece.Not many will like this film. That's the thing with cinema it's all subjectiv.I hope you enjoy this experience of a FILM.", 'Dune is technically perfect: direction, cinematography, score, acting, visual effects. It is truly a great cinematic experience and if you are interested you HAVE to go watch it in a theatre because it\'s visually majestic and the big screen helps fully enjoying it. Even the audio is important with a inspired score and great sounds in general and the big speakers of a theatre can contribute to a even better immersion. Dune is technically great as I said and it should be viewed but its "part one" nature is what could let down some viewers or maybe, as it has happened to me, not to fully appreciate the movie. In particular the protagonist has his arc and some important things happen but the movie does not tell a complete story and the ending seems more like the finale of a episode of a tv show rather than one of a movie and I\'m already anxiously waiting for the sequel. In conclusion Dune is certainly worth watching, especially in a theatre, even just for its aesthetics but be aware that it is not a conclusive movie and be prepared for that.', 'This movie was god awful boring. But I suspected teen girls who are ga ga over Timothee are giving this a 10.

The visuals are gorgeous and Frank Herbert's work is clearly understood and respected. But there is something slightly off, cant really put my finger on it. While the attempt David Lynch made (Dune, 1984) was a bit too out there and the filmmaker took too many liberties, Denis Villeneuve (Dune, 2021) was perhaps a bit too determined to not make the same mistake twice.Ive read the book a few months ago so I was still perfectly aware how the story develops. This made the film, dare I say it, a bit on the slow and dull side here and there. This was, like I said, more than made up by the gorgeous visuals and sounds, but I cant shake the thought that the story could have been told in a slightly more energetic way.All in all, a small complaint, and people who are new to the franchise, which I suspect will be many, perhaps do not feel that way. In the end I left the theatre more than satisfied, so still a 9/10 for me.", "Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel is a technical display of modern wizardry, an enormous and often thundering spectacle. It's best described as a sort of mix between Game of Thrones and Star Wars with religious parallels, which isn't very surprising since Herbert's novel was George Lucas' inspiration many decades ago.Dune's story is full of rich and often bizarre mythology, political conflicts on a galactic scale, raging battles between opposing forces and fantastical prophecies.It's a meticulously crafted vehicle to fully immerse you into the world; the movie takes deep care to establish lore and characters, unfolding at a slow pace. It's brilliantly directed in a calm but constantly tense premonition.The acting is superb all around, with standouts from Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica and Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd as the villainous Baron Harkonnen. The latter manages to give the story a menacing, borderline supernatural presence.Hans Zimmer's score invokes historical grandeur and a sort of legendary, Arthurian voice. Greg Fraiser's cinematography is vast and big, giving the story's magnitude the scope it deserves. This is a very unique looking production and it shows up on set and in costume, tremendous artwork and design.As far as criticism goes, the movie lacks a proper ending. Sure, it's not the first movie to end on a cliffhanger, but it could still warrant an understandably inconclusive feeling. Aside from that, the pacing is also a possible deterrent for some viewers. It's long and methodically structured.", "I see many people complayning about the long time without any action scene. This is not a classic science fiction movie it's art.", "Quoting a review of Rolf Kasparek's Giant X I album from the Encyclopedia Metallum, nothing is on the wall here. Not the big name actors who seem to make their impression of their previous interpretations (Jason Momoa is just aquaman with a cosmic suit on, Dave Bautista is back to his WWE days with shouting that would make Vince McMahon proud) or making their worst interpretations ever (the guy from the Oldboy Remake in particular), not the non-existant plot, and surely not belieavable situations/dialogues/whatever. The only thing on the wall here is the money WB possesses in the CGI/design department but nothing else. A complete waste in every way possible.And, BTW, congratulations to the reuse of some shots from the WW84 movie, the one with the wide camera of the Amazon's isle at the beginning of the movie. If you wonder why I'm mostly stuck to japanese stuff this day (anime or live action doesn't matter) don't look any further than this overblown crap. Don't look even twice at the title and move along, there's nothing here to be seen.", "Dune is an amazing movie. One of the best special effects ever. A crazy photograph that makes you love and hate the Dune desert at the same time. Villeneuve reaches its peak, demonstrating skill in managing the action scenes and making the slower scenes interesting, inevitable for the transposition of Herbert's novel. The very compelling storyline and the phenomenal cast. Hans Zimmer leaves us one of the best soundtracks of him. It's a movie to see, to see at the cinema! Only time will tell if we are faced with a masterpiece, but it has everything in order to become one. And remember it's part one.", "This movie is a true work of art, with stunning scenery, delightful music, an incredible score, and such amazing actors. There is a lot of different and unique elements to this thrilling and fascinating movie, such as the environment, the characters, the dialogue, the script, and so much more. This movie has an intriguing story that will keep you guessing throughout if you are unfamiliar with the classic novel or David Lynch's version, which I was. I think that Dune Part 1 is an amazing setup for a couple of sequels, this is just the beginning, this is only part 1 of such a unique, captivating and beautiful story that's being told. This is not a Sci-Fi movie to joke around with, this is exactly how a Sci-Fi movie should be.I know that some people might say that this movie is slow, and is leaving so much stuff uncovered and unspoken about, and it has a lot of plot holes, but I think that it's necessary to leave breathing space for the characters and the audience, this is such a broad universe to cover, and it is so hard to fit all that into one movie.With all that said, I really think that you can see and tell what depth and passion that has been put on the movie screen by Denis Villeneuve, and I am excited to see how the story unfolds in the years to come.I definitely recommend it.", "Where blade runner 2049 felt meandering - and it's best compared to blade runner 2049, both great movies - Dune always felt exciting. The great acting and directing gives the movie a soul of its own.This one is a cinema event. Music and sound effects, the large vistas, the grandiose battles. The special effects adds to the movie, making the fighting seem more desperate than it otherwise would have been. My biggest complaint is that it's made for pg rating.

Hoping the sequel is green lit.", 'They cud have at least added some solid action but they wanted to impress with the visuals n all.Now expect everyone to spend time n money on part 2.', "It's easy to feel fascinated by a movie this monumental. What Denis Villeneuve accomplished, with this masterful work, is something that I would define unbelievably epic, to say the least.The story of Dune takes inspiration from the book of the same name written by Frank Herbert, to start off with something fresh and new.Each actor from this stellar cast does his best to impersonate a well-developed and memorable character. Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet and Zendaya, in particular, stand out from the rest with their charming and powerful performances.Hans Zimmer really outdid himself, with an immersive soundtrack that proves, once again, that the right choice of music is essential to the overall sensoriale experience.The visual effects are some of the most impressive masterworks of digital art that I have seen in recent years. They are outstanding, incredible, phenomenal: that's because they allow you to immerse yourself deeply inside of the character-driven journey.Ultimately, this movie is an instant classic. We are witnessing the start of a new and exciting saga that is sure to convey a lot of drama and emotion to the public for years to come.", 'I am confident Denis Villeneuve\'s Dune will go down as the definitive screen version of Frank Herbert\'s revolutionary novel (as with Greta Gerwig\'s take on Little Women; technically the latest one of many, but undoubtedly the finest).We all know the 1984 David Lynch version and how fate was unkind to it. Some will also be aware of the previous attempt by Alejandro Jodorowsky, as documented in the film Jodorowsky\'s Dune, where the concept art by H. R. Giger at least eventually gave us 1979\'s Alien - this particular Dune adaptation was ultimately lost.Now, we have what\'s possibly the ultimate Dune film, and its director has been exquisitely selected, having previously expanded on Ridley Scott\'s Blade Runner in a way that made the world feel larger, without forgetting the themes and internal rules of what it set out to adapt. (I know a certain other science-fiction/Fantasy franchise that\'s been having some trouble with that; it was about stars going to war or some nonsense.) Granted, had Villeneuve truly been free from Sony\'s influence when he made Blade Runner 2049, we wouldn\'t have had Rick Deckard\'s involvement spoiled by the advertising.As for Dune, the world of its source material indeed feels more awesome in size - and intricate in detail - than in the 1984 film, and Villeneuve\'s knack for imposing visuals and atmosphere, resulting in that sense of interstellar awe that good science-fiction ought to bring, remains untarnished. He understands the sheer otherworldly potential of cinema, better than many other blockbuster-makers.Hollywood can render new CG worlds, "cool" creatures, and idiotic action scenes starring Black Widow to their heart\'s content; they will always seem cartoony and predictable without the right shading, weight simulation, framing, and sound design. It looks and feels as if we\'ve entered a distant moment in mankind\'s future, where the sights are truly new and humbling, yet our proclivity for conquest, fanaticism, and imperialism remains the same - they\'re not just dangling Cybertron or Lamentis in front of the adult babies\' faces.That being said, I admit there are some things that seem studio-imposed for the sake of juicy PR, including race- and gender-bending of various characters. The reason given by Warner Bros. Is that making the characters into ostensibly oppressed groups served to complement their roles in this universe; to better mirror our own peoples, or perhaps predict their fate. I understand the book was partially inspired by Middle Eastern culture and Islam, and that white-washing the "Fremen" in particular might\'ve weakened its impact - and, for lack of a better term, its relevance. My only issue is with the cringey reactions from the Usual Journalists.This is to say nothing of Vanity Fair\'s Generation Z-friendly reporting that Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet\'s character will be akin to Greta Thunberg if she was, and this is an actual quote, "a Jedi with a diploma from Hogwarts" (which several droning stans probably think she is already). I don\'t know that Dune ever panders to the little activists quite so embarrassingly, but the article surely turned some heads. This is what matters.Speaking of actors, the film features a myriad of Hollywood stars, all of them seminally cast in terms of both appearance and skill. Chalamet now plays Paul Atreides, Oscar Isaac portrays his father Leto (the Duke of House Atreides and the new head of the "spice-mining" colonies of Planet Arrakis), Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica, Zendaya is Chani, Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, Jason Momoa is Duncan Idaho, Javier Bardem is Stilgar, Charlotte Rampling is Gaius Helen Mohiam, and Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd (gloriously) plays the beastly Baron Harkonnen.There\'s also Dave Bautista as Harkonnen\'s most trusted nephew and David Dastmalchian as Piter, the "Mentat" of his house/planet. Many of these characters barely get an introduction - which is one of many ways that Dune feels exactly like what it is; the first half of the first book.Of course, not everything in the film feels "new". We\'ve naturally been to the world of Dune before, albeit a cornier version of it. Some images and themes bring Star Wars, Mad Max, The Chronicles of Riddick, and Oblivion to mind (note that the Dune books predate these works by a minimum of ten years), as well as previous Villeneuve pictures like Arrival and the aforementioned Blade Runner (there are even some visual call-backs to his first masterpiece Incendies).But it\'s the sense of scope he brings to these visuals that make them feel truly alien and intimidating, albeit maintaining a human element (i.e. The many great characters and their roles in the system) that makes this future seem believable; a world where computers are banished but we\'ve discovered the "spice" that may make our meaty brains surpass the computational power of machines. There is a sense that we\'ve come a long way, possibly much too far.', "I really don't see why this movie is so highly rated. It's slow, long and dark most of the time. The movie was so slow that couldn't justify watching it all at once. I found myself dozing off at times, playing word games on my phone at others. The soundtrack makes it a nice ambient background though (Thanks Hans Zimmer). The characters are not exciting, they just made the white of their eyes blue and that's it. I gave it 3 stars for the cinematography. For a movie to be so slow, why not just let it be a book? I think my imagination would have done a better job with what the characters and places look like. All the places in it look like earth and the extra terrestrials look human. There was no effort there. The acting is good but most of the actors they used to sell the movie and people were excited to see are in it for just a few minutes. Like Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin. Zendaya still has the same one facial expression she has in anything she's in. I guess the key to the success of this movie is a massive marketing campaign and it worked. Money, money, money...", "I put down a 10 to counter the stupidity that is reviewers that put down a 1 or 2 on this movie. Those same reviewer surely gave The Lobster and Dogtooth a 10, talk about snoozefest. Just because something is slow and complex, doesn't mean it's good. I would say, go watch it and make up you own mind.With that said, Dune would've done better with some more complexity.Dune had its best moments with Rebecca Ferguson when it came to acting. She didn't really fit in with the rest of the characters, but her character had me intrigued and interested the most.I will give Talamet a pass, since his character must have been heavyly directioned by the script and director. And he is a good actor, to say the least, but his character didn't really have me as hooked as the Lady Atreides character. He was missing something and I suspect that something had to do with the screenplay and dialogue. It needed more philosophy.What I would say added to the runtine must've been the overly excessive flashes of the future or possible future. And at times I found myself feeling like I was watching a raw cut. Alot of time went in to showing us some amazing landscapes and great views, but even that became overly excessive at times.The story overall was great and would've needed 2 more hours to capture the entirety of Frank Herbert's sandworld in this Part 1. But seeing how movies work, that would've been impossible. Maybe making a mini-series would've been better for the stories sake, but then we wouldn't have been able to watch it in the cinemas.All in all Dune delivered a great experience and has to be watched in a cinema at least ones.And like I said before, don't listen to all these hipsters that enjoy 3 hour dramas in the cinema, but miss to enjoy a intriguing and beautiful movie which didn't miss by much at all. So go to the cinema and make up your own mind.", "Dune is not just a movie with great potential. It is a great movie. Pacing is almost perfect, lighting and effects are beyond compare. Acting is really beliavable. Only big complaint is that this movie should have been r rated cause there were scenes where blood would have been nice to see. The cliffhanger wasn't annoying and you left with exitement.Once In life time experience\nAny scifi lover should see this movie.", "Visually, the movie is incredibly beautiful. Every shot is is gorgeous.The music is also very good and fits well with every scene.Even through the pacing is a bit slow compared to other big franchises, it's quite fitting.Acting was perfect.The story was also awesome. I now crave to see part 2. Hope it will come soon.", 'Here\'s my thoughts on Dune. But first and foremost, I must apologize if I put in spoilers in which I might not realize it or unintentionally. So sorry about that.So with that said...Wow! What can I say!Villeneuve\'s Dune is definitely way way different from the Lynch\'s version. It\'s not as weird or boring as that. Nor was it as wooden or overly-dramatic as the 2000s ScyFy series.The whole experience of it was somewhat, I would say, poetic yet serious in the likes of Christopher Nolan\'s "The Dark Knight" trilogy especially when it\'s augmented with Hans Zimmer\'s score.I would also like to highlight that there was a tinge of the 2015 Justin Kurzel\'s "Macbeth" where the atmosphere at times felt grim and gloomy. But that\'s not a bad thing. It just adds to the seriousness of the movie. Speaking of Macbeth, the movie does give off that Shakespearean quality about it which I very much appreciate it; hence why I thought this Villenueve\'s Dune is rather \'poetic\'.Before going into the movie, I was afraid that it be a snooze-fest just as Villeneuve\'s take on his "Blade Runner 2049" despite it being visually stunning. But as a fan of the books, I\'m certainly glad that it was far from boring. I don\'t feel like it is in any way a slow burn as what some reviewers described it. The pacing was just right like it was right out the book. Yet I couldn\'t say the same for those who are unfamiliar with the story. They might, I worry, get very impatient with it.And not to give anything away or spoilers, there were definitely changes from the source material. In particular, that dining room scene from the book where disagreements were expressed out among the characters was not in the movie. Another point to take note was the use of spoken languages among the various groups which I don\'t ever recall Herbert used in the book. Such that, they actually took the effort in creating languages to distinguish which group of characters they\'re from. It was interesting take that Dr Yueh was speaking in Mandarin while conversing with Paul and the latter responded with the same. I mean \'Yueh\' is, after all, a Chinese name so I think it\'s kinda appropriate. I also picked up some Arabic in some of the scenes especially when the Fremens were talking to themselves.As for performances, it is definitely Timothee Chalamet\'s shining achievement. This is his movie. Rebecca Furgeson also gave her possibly emotionally wrenching performance. There were scenes whereby I could empathize with her pain, not as a Bene Gesserit, but as Paul\'s mother. Oscar Isaac, too, was compelling and had me convinced that he was good enough to be Paul\'s father. Collectively, both Isaac and Furgeson played it excellently well as Paul\'s parents to give him enough care yet with firm sternness to protect their son.The scope of the movie was indeed epic in terms of the scale. For example, the sizes of the heighliners in comparisons to the smaller ships. Those were massive. Think those individual alien attacker crafts in "Independence Day" compared to the main mothership, except that the latter was three to four times larger. And those Ornithopters were perfectly made to mimic dragonflies yet upon closer look they do resemble helicopters. The costumes were stunning. So much so that I\'d described them as being "lyrical", if that makes sense.Hans Zimmer\'s score is also worth mentioning. It fits the movie perfectly but it does not overpower the feel of any scenes. Although I did find his use of bagpipes to be out of place. And sadly, we did not get to see Gurney Halleck strum his baliset. It\'d be interesting to see how Josh Brolin would sound like if he were to sing.For me, personally, the only thing that was amiss was the exclusion of the Emperor since he was mentioned many times throughout the movie but with no physical representation of himself on screen. And as many of us already knew, Feyd was not included in the movie and it did give the strange feeling that the main Harkonnen players were around except for him. Or Count Fenring, for that matter.Yet, all in all, they did capture the gist of the book so I\'m not disappointed at all. Dune was a beautifully made film that I wouldn\'t mind going for a second viewing. And I could certainly see that it would garner quite a substantial amount of nominations especially in the technical categories.', "In my opinion, this is not the masterpiece I had hoped for. I was never truly lost in the universe of the movie, forgetting time or consumed by the characters.However, DV proves once again, that he is the most interesting filmmaker in the film industry right now. He refuses to comply with the standard Hollywood narratives. His movies are original and unique. Like his masterpiece Sicario. He takes you on a ride, where you never know what's coming. You can't predict his storylines.So. I'm still onboard. Excited to watch part 2. Maybe still, DV's Dune will turn out a masterpiece in the end.", 'Watching this movie was an astonishing experience. Seing those beautiful sceneries while hearing Hans Zimmer soundtracks is quite the experience. Even tho there is no mindblowing factor in this movie, its still a good sci fi fantasy movie.', "Despite being merely a prologue the movie sets up a benchmark for the following part(s) and it won't be easy to live up to the same high standart that was set.", 'Quite simply, much too focused on visuals (which are in fact beautiful), but NOT nearly enough on dialogues, story and character development.Music score is OK.This doesn\'t do justice to extensive, complex and compelling source material such as Herbert\'s Dune.The Lynch adaptation has been criticized a lot for a number of reasons, but in my opinion it still is superior to this "reboot", despite the obvious disparity in terms of resources, technology and runtime.', "This was the movie I was looking for ward since I knew it was happening. Got excited after the trailers and was a huge letdown for me. The music is terrible. It's like those ridiculous background musics from documentaries. I have never liked Zendaya, she is overrated there are far better actors not getting as much attention as she does. And she does not deserves it. Timoth√É¬®e is a great actor, loved him in The King especially. Dave Bautista is underrated and he is just getting better in acting. The big stars were wasted on this movie. Great visuals aren't the first things that makes a movie enjoyable. Me personally not a big fan of CGI anyways. I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a movie. I don't even care what's in Part 2. Whatever you say, we who grew up in the 80s just adore the old movie and after seeing this I adore it more. I was generous with my 4/10 btw.", 'My first impression was as if the sound director was def, because the sound was incredibly loud. The actors were mumbling the sentences (nothing new here).A lot of good special effects and a little meaning. The whole film was afloat just thanks to Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet, who was very good.I am really surprised by IMDB user rating. Was expecting a bit more from Villeneuve, who is a good director.', 'Spectacular visuals, a very powerful soundscape and stellar performances.Highs would be Rebecca Ferguson and lows Jason Momoa. Not that he is bad but compared to the others hes "just being Jason Momoa"The world building maybe slowed the movie down but i enjoyed it 100%.It does hurt the movie a little bit that we only get half the book to be honest.Thats only nitpicking though.To me it felt like a true adaption of the book and i can not wait for Part 2!', 'Dune isn\'t the movie that any of us expected (especially not the ending). But the original story is so grandiose and long, that telling it in one sitting would be too difficult. One could argue that two movies might not even do the story and works justice.Anyway, this is not the epic movie that people expected beforehand. Yes, it was visually stunning with fantastic sound design (including music) and great acting. But it was not the action packed movie that you might have expected from the trailer, the first movie adaptation, or even the book. Is that a bad thing though? Not in my opinion.It sets a great tone and much like the characters in the story, you feel trapped in the situation. Even before they leave their home planet, Paul and his family (especially his dad) seem to be aware of the fact that their hand is forced and that their house is in tremendous danger. That "trapped" feeling never leaves you and only becomes stronger as the movie progresses due to its scenes and tempo. But that means it "lacks" in the blockbuster action (though it is there).To sum it up:\nDune is like foreplay. You have to be able to enjoy the continuous tension and the lack of a climax.Those who love that, will love Dune. Those looking for a quick "bang", will not.', "Compared to your typical block buster, who are usually fast and with fun jokes.Dune takes the time to show a complex universe, the story takes time and is serious.But the scenes, the designs, the architectures, are amazing, and we can't applaud enough the work of the artists on this movie.", "Dune is an immaculate experience, I chose to not watch any trailers or do research before the film and I'm quite happy I did. Some people may find it overlong and I could agree with 150 minutes being too much for the first part of a film series but I still was sitting in the edge of my seat wondering what was about to happen the whole time. The acting was great and Hans Zimmer delivered as usual. Villeneuve has put his soul into the film and every single shot is an artwork in itself. Hoping there'll be a second part, go and watch this film.", "As a person who was a fan of the book series for years, I can say that this movie delivers everything that I had hoped for and more. I saw it on an IMAX screen and believe me, the scale and the visuals were just stunning. Great work by the actors and the cinematography was fantastic. A wonderful adaptation by Villeneuve that lacks some parts I love from the books hence the 9/10 rating but still manages to deliver the feel and the essence of the story. It felt like the way I imagined the story was turned solid and that's the highest praise I can give this film.", 'For a bad script, a weak scene as for a very bad assignment of the actors with respect to the movie Dune 1984. It costs a lot of money to make a movie to later find these terrible results.', 'Amazing story, visuals, clothing, acting and casting, filming, scenery. I sat on the edge of the cinema chair for 2.5 hours and wanted more when it ended. Insanely well made, very surprised. Looking forward to part II already √∞≈∏¬§‚Äú', "I am a huge si-fi/fantasy fan. I have not read the book but I knew I would most likely at least like the film based on what I had read about it.I normally think films don't get enough credit, I will typically complain most films are rated too low. But I honestly didn't get this at all, even though it is my favourite genre. And oh my was this far too long for its own good.I had to fight every urge to stand up and walk out of the theatre. It failed miserably to create and explain the universe in which it all takes place. I kept thinking that this could learn a thing or two from the Lord of the Rings, where you are drawn in straight away by the mysterious/enchanting world and the different people within it.In the case of Dune, not only did I not understand where all these different people came from and what there issues/motives were (or maybe I just passed out and fell on the floor, wouldn't have made a difference as far as I'm concerned).No endearing characters, I can't even remember their names. I didn't care what happened to them nor do I remember their fates as I sit here and write.Nothing interesting about the worlds/planets. There was however a lot of super boring conversation that made me want to choke on my popcorns. I think at least half of the excitement in this genre is to get a feel for the universe where it all takes place but oh my Lord did this not deliver in that department.", "Visually stunning and... well, that's it. We don't get a sense of what's really going on and why. I know, because I have read the book several times during my lifetime but people who haven't would struggle, I think.I said visually stunning, but I was actually disappointed with some of the computer-generated special effects. They reminded me of video games, to be honest.There was no real sense of the politics of it all. Oh, OK, we got the bits about the spice and the fear the Emperor had of the Duke, who was popular, but then when the Landsraad was mentioned, who would have known what it was? Why did the Guild need the spice? How come the Sardaukar were so ferocious?Yes, we knew if we'd read the book, but one couldn't tell just from seeing the film.I'll watch the second instalment, if it's ever made, but it won't be with bated breath that I'll be waiting.", 'From a cineast point of view, this movie is perfect. But that is not what the book should be about. Who has read Dune knows that philosophy dominating the book and this was completely missed out.Women are extremely dominant in the book. The Bene Gesserit are a religious order who have a lot of power. This power was lost. We also miss out the Mentat which are also central to the book. Peter de Vries was completely missed out (a central figure in the book). And then the water. One of the most central element of the Fremen philsophy missed out. Also the effect of spice on the mind. Lost.And of course, we have a gender change + color change with Liet Kynes.In short, the makers created a movie with a lot of action and shooting, it has an amazing cineast experience. But the soul of the book was missed.', "Didn't really know what to expect when we sat down for this one. After 15 minutes in I knew I was in for something special. The visual effects, music score, (Hans Zimmerman) and the acting made it into a special Saturday night at the movies. One piece of advice if I may. If you do decide to enjoy this movie, do it in a theatre with Imax, or something to that effect. It will put you in a place where you should be when watching it. It's a real good movie. It really is. Sure it's a long one so you will be in for a longer sit down. It's worth your while though. I hope that part 2 will go into production soon.", "I did not read the book so I have no comparison, but this film is boring and pointless. With such a good cast I would have expected more.No explanation is given about anything. The charcters don't seem to have any motivation for what they do or any background or ambition, therefore it is really difficult to understand them, to sympathize with them and get attached. Nothing happens in over 2 and half hours: I do understand that this only part 1 and you want to leave the main action for part 2 but you need to give the audiance something to look forward to. Instead, when I got to the end I did not wonder what happens next, I wasn't left with the feeling that I need to see what happens next. I was just glad it was over after such a long time.", 'If you survive the first 30 minutes of grandiloquent dialogues, you\'ll get to watch a good movie with a lot of great FX and action sequences.It\'s called "Dune: Part One" and it seems there will be a trilogy.', 'You know when you have to pee in the movie but u dont want to go so u dont miss a second of the movie ? The movie was that good !!!!!', 'This movie is very, very faithful to the book it\'s based on. Naturally, some things have been distilled or adapted out, but they are rather minor and not (in my opinion) relevant to the plot or the characters. The story takes its time unfolding, and the viewers can immerse themselves in the world and the circumstances or our protagonists. Cinematography and score are amazing. I was absolutely floored by the magnitude of the visuals (some elements were, I think, borrowed from the 1984 adaptation) and the perfect soundtrack. The acting is great. The pacing is great. It\'s a complex story that needs room to breathe. I just hope that it\'s successful enough to get a "Part 2". I love the original novel and, despite the fact that I have a special place in my heart for the 1984 movie and the SciFi miniseries, this adaptation is by far the best, most faithful, and most visually dazzling.', 'It has been one year and eight months (approx.) since the world went into lockdown and cinemas closed, and studios postponed hundred of releases. During this pandemic, there have been ups and downs concerning the reopening of cinema, and with a little luck, some movies had a limited run in some theaters last year, moreover, some films going directly to streaming services. Now, the situation in Denmark has been very different compared to other nations, but luckily our theaters opened for good in May 2021, the films began coming back. Though I really liked movies such as "The Green Knight" which I saw in the cinema, there hasn\'t been one film in a long time when I have thought: this is a masterpiece; this is cinema. Until now."Dune" is a masterpiece. It is first-class movie making and one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had. Not only did Villeneuve manage to adapt a story into a film that is supposedly impossible to make, but he also did it with excellence. "Dune" is an epic in every way. Its grand production design and world-building take ones\' breath away from the first glimpse of the desolated planet. The visual effects are jarring and completely emerge into the real set pieces to make a realistic depiction of a future world. Costumes and make-up are creatively put together and adapts an impossible atmosphere to the story. "Dune" is just a stunning-looking film.Villeneuve\'s masterful direction is one thing. Another this that is as good, and maybe probably is my favorite part of the film is Hans Zimmer\'s score. Though Zimmer\'s career, he has made iconic scores to numerous huge and influential films. Music that can stay in your mind for days, and you can listen to and feel you\'re in the world. What Zimmer did with his score for "Dune" is simply out of this world. It\'s instrumental with choir and big ass drums and horns that will blow you up from your seat. The atmosphere he creates is unbelievable and never gets boring or in the way of the story. Zimmer uses tricks to mix sounds into the score, so it feels supernatural to see the big actions scenes and not think "Hmm that\'s a good score," because you don\'t notice it because it\'s so deep down part of this film. He will and surely deserves to win an Oscar for his work here. It\'s just been released on Spotify and other streaming services so if you can\'t wait, go listen to it.Villeneuve has before taken up almost impossible projects and made them work. His vision for "Dune" is so compact and tolerable that I couldn\'t see anyone else\'s creativity affect "Dune." Every aspect he put in play with the characters and the way he wants to move the camera is incredible. His direction is first-class movie making and quite possibly his best work next to "Arrival." It feels grand and epic in the same tone as "The Lord of the Rings" feels humongous in its character gallery and universe.The story is rich in characters, and all the actors do an equally great job embodying each person. Timot√É¬©e Chalamet, as the lead, Paul, does an amazing job portraying this ambiguous hero. Though his character for some part of the film is mostly held back because of his father (Oscar Isaac), Paul learns much about leadership and why the planet of Arrakis feels familiar to him. Isaac is a scene-stealer every time he\'s on screen. He\'s such a likable character that easily could have been a clich√É¬©tic menacing-king with his only desire to rule and gain power. His performance is beyond what I expected; he\'s terrific.Rebecca Ferguson also gets better and better in every single film she does. I loved her in "Doctor Sleep," and in "Dune" she shows a more quiet and subtle yet powerful performance. The rest of the cast is bloody amazing. Everybody could be a stand-out alone, and reminds me a lot of the character depth there is in each of the fellowship members in "The Lord of the Rings."Was I excited for "Dune?" Absolutely! I can\'t wait to buy it on Blu-ray and dive into the story again. My girlfriend, who loves epic sci-fi/adventures told me that it has probably become one of her favorite films. Though it doesn\'t fall into my top 50, I can\'t do anything but give it a top score. What "Dune" manages to do cannot be seen through. And I have missed it. I have missed it so damn much to feel engaged and to be fed with a story with so much flesh on. To relive the old days of cinema and to look forward to a new and exciting adventure. I\'ll be seeing "Dune" again sometime next week. Hopefully, a second movie will come because this IS only part one. Don\'t expect to be fully satisfied. This is only the beginning.']
